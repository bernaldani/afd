<p>
The FD is responsible to send and retrieve the files via the corresponding
protocols. Currently only the FTP, FTPS, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS and SCP protocol
is implemented.
</p>
<p>
For sending files (push) FD  waits for messages to arrive in the message
FIFO ($AFD_WORK_DIR/fifodir/msg.fifo) from the AMG.  It will then check
if it may start the corresponding process <a href="#send_file_local">
sf_loc</a>, <a href="#send_file_smtp">sf_smtp</a> or <a href="#send_file_ftp">
sf_ftp</a>, so that the files can be distributed. Only 30
(MAX_DEFAULT_CONNECTIONS) processes may distribute files at one time. If
not, it will store  the message in a internal queue where the message will
stay until a process slot is free. This queue will be sorted by
priority and in what order the messages arrive from the AMG. It can be viewed
with the tool queue_spy in the sbin directory. The output looks as follows:

FD is also responsible to collect files (only FTP, FTPS, HTTP and HTTPS) from
a remote host.  For this it makes a connection to the remote host at a regular
interval or at certain configurable times and check if there are any files to
fetch. Such files will be stored into a internal directory of the AFD
which is monitored by AMG. Thus giving the full flexibility of the
DIR_CONFIG file.

<h3 align=center><u><a name="send_file_ftp">Get and Send File FTP</a></u></h3>
<p>
'sf_ftp' is the process responsible to transmit (push) files via
<a href="glossary.html#FTP">FTP</a>. It does so by using its own FTP-client
that has build in a subset of the FTP protocol (<a href="../txt/rfc959.txt">
RFC 959</a> and <a href="../txt/rfc2228.txt">RFC 2228</a>). This has the
advantage that the transfer of a file can be monitored byte for byte and not
file by file, when using the client of the implementation. Another advantage
is that, since the clients of different implementation differ, it makes the
AFD more portable.
</p>
<p>
The process 'gf_ftp' is very similar to 'sf_ftp', the only difference
being that it fetches files from a remote FTP-server (pull).
</p>
<p>
The FTP-clients of the AFD currently has the following features:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Do secure communication for both control and data connection using
       secure sockets (TLS/SSL).</li>
   <li>Change the transfer type.</li>
   <li>Change the remote directory.</li>
   <li>Create the remote directory, recursivly if necessary.</li>
   <li>Rename a file.</li>
   <li>Delete files on the remote site. This is useful when
       sending lock files.</li>
   <li>Both active and passive mode are supported.</li>
   <li>Change the mode of a file that was transmitted.</li>
   <li>Execute a command on the remote site for each file transmitted.</li>
   <li>It appends a file on the remote site when the transmission was
       interrupted. This is very useful with very large files and buggy
       connections.</li>
   <li>Get a 'dir' listing from the remote site.</li>
   <li>To reduce latency it can combine the rename procedure RNFR and
       RNTO.</li>
   <li>Show all commands it sends and receives from the remote server
       in a log file (see <a href="log.html#transfer_debug_log">Transfer
       Debug Log</a>). This helps to locate errors very quickly when
       the transfer has failed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 align=center><u><a name="send_file_smtp">Send File SMTP</a></u></h3>
<p>
This program is used to send mail via <a href="glossary.html#SMTP">SMTP</a>
(<a href="../txt/rfc821.txt">RFC 821</a>) and according to MIME
(<a href="../txt/rfc1521.txt">RFC 1521</a> and
<a href="../txt/rfc1522.txt">RFC 1522</a>). With the
<a href="amg.html#attach_file">attach file</a> option it is possible
to send binary files as mail. The encoding will be done in BASE64.
</p>
<h3 align=center><u><a name="send_file_local">Send File Local</a></u></h3>
<p>
This process moves (when in the same file system) or copies the files from
one directory to another. It is able to change the mode or owner of each
file that it has copied.
</p>
<h3 align=center><u><a name="send_file_wmo">Send File WMO</a></u></h3>
<p>
This program is only useful if files should be send with the WMO-socket
procedure. Since WMO-sockets are insecure (data can be lost) it can be
optionaly configured to acknowledge each message.
</p>
<h3 align=center><u><a name="get_file_http">Get File HTTP</a></u></h3>
<p>
'gf_http' is the process responsible to receive (pull) files via
<a href="glossary.html#HTTP">HTTP</a>. It does so by using its own HTTP-client
that has build in a subset of the HTTP protocol (<a href="../txt/rfc2616.txt">
RFC 2616</a> and <a href="../txt/rfc2617.txt">RFC 2617</a>).
</p>
<p>
The HTTP-client of the AFD currently has the following features:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Do secure communication using secure sockets (TLS/SSL).</li>
   <li>Is able to do chunk reading.</li>
   <li>Change the remote directory.</li>
   <li>Delete files on the remote site.</li>
   <li>Show all commands it sends and receives from the remote server
       in a log file (see <a href="log.html#transfer_debug_log">Transfer
       Debug Log</a>). This helps to locate errors very quickly when
       the transfer has failed.</li>
