<p>
Run ./configure to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
./configure --help gives a list of possible options with slightly
longer descriptions in README.configure. Read this since here you
can decide what parts of AFD you want to compile and how and where
you want it to install the binaries.
</p>
<p>
But before you start you need to ensure that your system has all the
required packages installed. Here follow some system specific description
on how to install the necessary tools:
<ul>
   <li>RedHat/CentOS/Scientific Linux up to 6.x</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      yum install gcc openmotif-devel openssl-devel libXaw-devel libXpm-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>Fedora up to Version 17</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm
      yum install gcc openmotif-devel openssl-devel libXaw-devel libXpm-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>Fedora as of Version 18</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      yum install gcc motif-devel openssl-devel libXaw-devel libXpm-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>Ubuntu</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      sudo apt-get install gcc make libmotif-dev libssl-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev libxpm-dev libxaw7-dev
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>SuSE</li>
   <ul>
      <pre>
      su -
      zypper install gcc make openmotif-devel libopenssl-devel
      </pre>
   </ul>
   <li>MacOS</li>
   <ul>
      <p>
      For gcc download and install the Apple development environment
      https://developer.apple.com/xcode/. In XCode, install the optional
      components "command line tools" from the "Downloads" preference
      pane, then gcc is available on the Mac.
      </p>
      <p>
      For X11 install XQuartz http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/
      zypper install gcc make openmotif-devel libopenssl-devel
      </p>
   </ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You need to decide where you want to install AFD and if you want other
users to have access to your AFD. There are three different security
models, the default is "single user" where only the user that has started
the AFD may have access and may control it. "Group access" is where all
members of the same group may see and control the AFD. To activate this
configure must be called with --enable-group_can_write. The third model
is "any user", where any user may see things and have access and
can be activated with the --enable-setuid_progs. The access can be
controlled on a much finer level when using the <a href="afd_users.html">
afd.users</a> configuration file. The "any user" model together with
afd.users will give you the best control over who may do what, but be
aware that some binaries will have the setuid bit flag set. So you should
not use this when the binaries belong to root.
</p>
<p>
Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.
You can do that on the command line like this:
</p>
<pre>
            ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix
</pre>
<p>
Before compiling you might want to set some other preferences in
src/afdsetup.h and/or src/init_afd/afddefs.h. Some of these values
can also be set via configure parameters:
</p>
<pre>
           --with-max-no-of-parallel-jobs=N
           --with-default-no-of-parallel-jobs=N
           --with-default-archive-unit=N
           --with-max-hostname-length=N
           --with-max-dir-alias-length=N
</pre>
<p>
But note with AFD version before 1.4.6, changing some values here might
make this incompatible with a previous AFD version and AFD will no longer
work when it is started. So best to leave these values as they are. If
you do change them it's best to run the following command before starting
AFD again:
</p>
<pre>
            afd -i
</pre>
<p>
This will initialize the internal database of AFD. After this it will be
possible to run AFD with the new values. As of version 1.4.6 this is no
longer required and AFD does it automatically for you.
</p>
<p>
Now everything is setup for compiling, run the following command:
</p>
<pre>
            make
</pre>
<p>
To speed up this process try use the -jN parameter, where N is the number
of cpu cores you have available.
</p>
<p>
The next step is  to install the binaries. This is done with the following
command:
</p>
<pre>
            make install
</pre>
