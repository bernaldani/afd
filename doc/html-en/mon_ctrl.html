<p>
To control and monitor remote AFDs there is an X11 interface, with the
following appearance:
</p>
<center><img src="../images/mon_ctrl_labeled.png" alt="[image of labeled mon_ctrl dialog]"></center>
<p>
As shown this dialog is divided into four main areas: menu, heading,
connection and status.
</p>
<h3 align=center><a name="menu"><u>Menu</u></a></h3>
<p>
The menu area has four pull down buttons: Monitor, RView, RControl and Setup.
If your mon_ctrl window does not have all buttons shown and described here,
then the system administrator did not allow you to use this function.
