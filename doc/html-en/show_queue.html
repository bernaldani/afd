       it will always take the earliest or latest entries it finds. There
       are two time forms. One is the absolute and the other is the

       MMDDhhmm, DDhhmm and hhmm (MM = month [01-12], DD = day [01-31],
       hh = hour [00 - 23], mm = minute [00 - 59]). The relative form
       always starts with a hyphen '-' and has the following format:

<p>
It is not necessary to fill in any values, however it might be, depending
on the number of files in the queue, that the numbers found is very large.
While the dialog is searching for data, the function of the search button
changes into a stop button, enabling the user to interrupt the search (this
does not yet work very well, it depends very much on the speed of the machine).
This button and the slider of the list widget are the only buttons that are
active during a search. Thus, the user can search in the list widget by
using the slider, while the dialog is still searching. Once a search is
interrupted, the search will always start from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Here follows a short description of the list widgets and the meaning of
each item:

   <td>The time in the following format: hh:mm:ss where hh is the hour

   <td>The host name of the remote host.</td>

When the file name is longer then it is shown in the list widget it is
still possible to view it by using the 'AFD info click'. This is done
by pressing the right mouse button while the cursor is over the wanted
item in the list widget. The following window will pop up for a file
in the output queue:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_queue_info1.png" alt="[picture of info dialog output]"></center>
</p>
<p>
And for the input queue it will look as follows:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_queue_info2.png" alt="[picture of info dialog input]"></center>
</p>
<p>
And for the retrieve queue it will look as follows:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_queue_info3.png" alt="[picture of info dialog retrieve]"></center>
</p>
<p>
As shown, this window also shows what is configured in the DIR_CONFIG for
this file.
</p>
<p>
Directly under the list file listing of the queue is the summary line
showing, if no item is selected, the sum of all files and the total size.
If files are selected it will show the sum of all selected files.
</p>
<p>
Under the summary line follows a staus line showing what it is currently
doing and what it has done. At the end of a search it will print how
long the search took.
</p>
<p>
At the bottom is a line with up to six (depending on user permissions) buttons
which have the following meaning:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_queue_button_line.gif" alt="[closeup of the button line]"></center>

   <td>Pressing this button will start the search. During the search the
       name of the button will change to Stop. Pressing this will interrupt
       the search and the button will be renamed to Search again. Pressing
       search again will start the search from the beginning and not where
       it was when it was interrupted.</td>

   <td>Depending on what is configured in <a href="afd_config.html">
       AFD_CONFIG</a>, this will show the image or the content of
       the dialog. By default when nothing is configured it will
       show the content of the file as shown on the right side. See
       <a href="afd_config.html#view_data_prog">VIEW_DATA_PROG</a>
       for more details on how to set this to use other programs

       queue and the active retrieve jobs (those marked (OU, OEU and R).</td>

</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>Send</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>This will popup the <a href="xsend_file.html">xsend_file</a> dialog
