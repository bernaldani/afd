       it will always take the earliest or latest entries it finds. There
       are two time forms. One is the absolute and the other is the
       relative time format. The following absolute forms are possible:
       MMDDhhmm, DDhhmm and hhmm (MM = month [01-12], DD = day [01-31],
       hh = hour [00 - 23], mm = minute [00 - 59]). The relative form
       always starts with a hyphen '-' and has the following format:
       -DDHhhmm, -hhmm or -mm.</td>

       the files have to wait. When the button Unsent is set all files
       that are currently being transmitted or those in a job that is

<p>
It is not necessary to fill in any values, however it might be, depending
on the number of files in the queue, that the numbers found is very large.
While the dialog is searching for data, the function of the search button
changes into a stop button, enabling the user to interrupt the search (this
does not yet work very well, it depends very much on the speed of the machine).
This button and the slider of the list widget are the only buttons that are
active during a search. Thus, the user can search in the list widget by
using the slider, while the dialog is still searching. Once a search is
interrupted, the search will always start from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Here follows a short description of the list widgets and the meaning of
each item:
</p>

       (01-12) and DD is the day of the month (01-31).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Time</td>
   <td>The time in the following format: hh:mm:ss where hh is the hour
       (00-23), mm is the minute (00-59) and ss is the second (00-59).</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
   <td>Type</td>
   <td>
      <table border>
         <tr>
            <td align=center>I</td>
            <td>Input queue</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>

            <td>Unsent</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td align=center>E</td>
            <td>In error directory. This is only used for files in the
                output queue.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td align=center>R</td>
            <td>Active retrieve job.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td align=center>RP</td>
            <td>Pending retrieve job.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td align=center>0 - 9</td>
            <td>The priority of this file. This can only by shown for the
                output queue since in the input queue this is not known.</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Hostname</td>
   <td>The host name of the remote host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>File size</td>
   <td>The size of the file in bytes.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
When the file name is longer then it is shown in the list widget it is
still possible to view it by using the 'AFD info click'. This is done
by pressing the right mouse button while the cursor is over the wanted
item in the list widget. The following window will pop up for a file
in the output queue:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_queue_info1.png" alt="[picture of info dialog output]"></center>
</p>
<p>
And for the input queue it will look as follows:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_queue_info2.png" alt="[picture of info dialog input]"></center>
</p>
<p>
And for the retrieve queue it will look as follows:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/show_queue_info3.png" alt="[picture of info dialog retrieve]"></center>
</p>
<p>
As shown, this window also shows what is configured in the DIR_CONFIG for
this file.
</p>
<p>
With the delete button at the bottom it is possible to remove selected
files from the list. However, you cannot delete unsent files in the
output queue (those marked as OU or OEU).
