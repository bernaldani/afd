The show_log dialog was designed to continously show all activities
in the given (system, receive, transfer or transfer debug) log file. Even when
a log file is full and a new one is opened show_log will notice this
and continue to show the newest information. It is also possible to view
just a certain log level for example only errors and warnings.
