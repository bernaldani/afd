<h1 align=center>Installing AFD</h1>
<hr size=3 noshade>
<p>
Run ./configure to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
./configure --help gives a list of possible options with slightly
longer descriptions in README.configure. Read this since here you
can decide what parts of AFD you want to compile and how and where
you want it to install the binaries.
</p>
<p>
Here you need to decide where you want to install AFD and if you want other
users to have access to your AFD. There are three different security
models, the default is "single user" where only the user that has started
the AFD may have access and may control it. "Group access" is where all
members of the same group may see and control the AFD. To activate this
configure must be called with --enable-group_can_write. The third model
is "any user", where any user may see things and have access and
can be activated with the --enable-setuid_progs. The access can be
controlled on a much finer level when using the <a href="afd_users.html">
afd.users</a> configuration file. The "any user" model together with
afd.users will give you the best controll over who may do what, but be
aware that some binaries will have the setuid bit flag set. So you should
not use this when the binaries belong to root.
</p>
<p>
Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.
You can do that on the command line like this:
</p>
<pre>
            ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix
</pre>
<p>
Before compiling you might want set some other preferences in src/afdsetup.h
and/or src/init_afd/afddefs.h. But note, changing some values here might
make this incompatible with a previous AFD version and AFD will no longer
work when it is started. So best to leave these values as they are. If
you do change them it's best to run the following command before starting
AFD again:
</p>
<pre>
            afd -i
</pre>
<p>
This will initialize the internal database of AFD. After this it will be
possible to run AFD with the new values.
</p>
<p>
Now everything is setup for compiling, run the following command:
</p>
<pre>
            make
</pre>
<p>
This will take a while depending of what you included and how fast
your system is. If this is succesful do a:
</p>
<pre>
            make install
</pre>
