<h1 align=center><a name="afd_control">AFD Control</a></h1>
<hr size=3 noshade>
<p>
To control and monitor the AFD there is an X11 interface, with the
following appearance:
</p>
<center><img src="../images/afd_ctrl_labeled.gif" alt="[labeled picture of afd_ctrl dialog]"></center>
<p>
As shown this dialog is divided into four main areas: menu, heading, connection
and status.
</p>
<h3 align=center><a name="menu"><u>Menu</u></a></h3>
<p>
The menu area has five pull down buttons: Host, View, Control and Setup.
If your afd_ctrl window does not have all buttons shown and described here,
then the system administrator did not allow you to use this function,
see <a href="afd_users.html">afd.users</a> for more details.
