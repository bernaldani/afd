General
=======

Have a configuration file $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/group_load_balancing, in which
we can specify a group of host alias that share the load. Things that one
should be able to specify, is which load values are of interest, those
could be:

        - the load of the remote AFD
             - number of files
             - size
             - the number of process executing
        - the load of the remote system
             - cpu usage
             - wait IO
        - how many files + size we currently transmit to this AFD

AFDD
====

Additional command that when issued sends load data of the AFD and optionally
of the system. It should just return one integer value a so called load
factor.


FD
==

Should connect to all remote afdd's and always get the load factor.
