 - Tell the system NOT to bother modifying the last access times on files.
   This can be done with the chattr call as root as shown below:

      chattr -R +A archive messages files

   NOTE: Also set all input directories of AFD with this flag! Only
         files created in such directories will have the A flag set.
         NOT if one is hard-linked!
