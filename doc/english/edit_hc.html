<P>
This dialog is used to configure the destination host. It will also
allow one to change the ordering of the host names in the afd_ctrl
dialog by simply dragging and dropping a selected host name. It is
only possible to have one of this dialog open at the same time.

   <TD>Alias Hostname</TD>
   <TD>In this list widget, all host alias names found in the DIR_CONFIG
       are listed in the order that they are found there. In order to make a
       change for any host it must first be selected by clicking on it. By
       dragging the host name with the middle mouse button, one can change
       the ordering in the afd_ctrl dialog. When dragging the cursor will
       turn into a <IMG SRC="../images/bee.gif">, the feelers at the top
       left are the hot spot of the cursor. The changes will only become
       effective when the update button was pressed.</TD>

   <TD>Host Switching</TD>
   <TD>When the toggle button for Host switching is turned on (inserted)
       it is possible to have two addresses for a single host. The
       second host is always regarded as the secondary host. The user
       may can change to the secondary host or main host by pressing
       the <A HREF="afd_ctrl.html#Switch host">Switch host button</A>.
       In the Host 1 and Host 2 fields characters can be entered that
       distinguish the two hosts from each other. The character will
       be appended to the end of the alias host name.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD>&nbsp<B>3</B>&nbsp</TD>
   <TD>Real Hostname</TD>
   <TD>Here you may specify the real host name or IP number. This has the
       advantage that you can give remote hosts names that are not in
       the local /etc/hosts file or the name server. If a secondary host
       is available, the second host field will be active.</TD>

          <TD>Transfer timeout</TD>
          <TD>The time how long the AFD should wait for a reply from the
              remote site.</TD>
       </TR>
       <TR>
          <TD>Retry interval</TD>
          <TD>If an error occurs, this is the delay (in seconds) before
              another transfer is initiated.</TD>

          <TD>Maximum errors</TD>
          <TD>If max. errors is reached the destination identifier turns
              'red'. If error retries reaches twice max. errors the queue
              of this host will be paused.</TD>
       </TR>
       <TR>
          <TD><A NAME="successful_retries">Successful retries</A></TD>
          <TD>This is only used when there is a secondary host and
              automatic switch over is active. It is the number of
              successful transfers to the secondary host, before it tries
              to switch back to the main host to see if it is alive
              again.</TD>

       <TR>
          <TD>Max. parallel transfers</TD>
          <TD>The maximum number of parallel transfers for this host.</TD>
       </TR>
       <TR>
          <TD>Transfer Blocksize</TD>
          <TD>The size of the blocks being used to send files to the
              remote host (in Bytes).</TD>
       </TR>
       <TR>
          <TD>File size offset</TD>
          <TD>When transmitting large files and the transfer gets interrupted,
              the AFD can append a file on the remote site. For this it needs
              to know the file size on the remote site. And to get the size it
              does a dir 'filename' at the remote site. Due to different
              replies of the FTP servers, the position of the file size is
              needed. You can easily determine this value simply doing an FTP
              to the remote site and a dir and count the spaces to the file size.
              For example:
              <PRE>
             -rw-r--r--   1 afd      mts-soft   14971 Jan  3 17:16

                        1  2     3            4
              </PRE>
              i.e. the file size offset is 4.</TD>
       </TR>
       <TR>
          <TD>Number of no bursts</TD>
          <TD>The number of connections that may not burst. This is useful
              for connections where there is lots of files which are being
              send with the same low priority and only a few files that do
              have a very high priority. Without this option (ie. it is
              set to zero), files with lower priority are constantly
              appended to current jobs (bursting) without the higher
              priority jobs ever getting a chance.</TD>
