This file contains some parameter settings that are always read when
the AFD is started. The following table shows and describes what
parameters can be set and which programs must be restarted to activate
the new value:

<tr>
   <th>Parameter</th>
   <th>Description</th>
   <th>Default</th>
   <th>Restart</th>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>AFD_TCP_PORT</td>
   <td>The TCP port number at which the process afdd will listen and
       wait for remote requests. If that port is currently in use
       by another program it will add one and see if that works
       so long until it finds a free port. NOTE: If this option
       is not set the afdd process will NOT start.</td>
   <td>4444</td>
   <td>afdd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>TRUSTED_REMOTE_IP</td>
   <td>Trusted IP-number that may connect to AFD_TCP_PORT. To
       enter more then one IP-number you must have the
       identifier TRUSTED_REMOTE_IP on a new line for each number.
       Wildcards may also be used when specifying the IP-number.
       If TRUSTED_REMOTE_IP is not set, all hosts may connect.</td>
   <td>None</td>
   <td>afdd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>MAX_NO_OF_DIR_CHECKS</td>
   <td>This is the number of times dir_check my fork itself to
       copy or exec some command.</td>

       directory.</td>

   <td>AMG</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>AMG_DIR_RESCAN_TIME</td>
   <td>The rescan time of the local user directories in the DIR_CONFIG
       file. This does not effect the rescan time of remote directories,
       which is set with REMOTE_FILE_CHECK_INTERVAL. Don't pick a small
       value here if your system shows high system load when working
       with files or directories (eg. fault tolerant systems). This is
       also the interval time that the AMG checks if the DIR_CONFIG or
       HOST_CONFIG file have been changed. The unit is second.</td>
   <td>5</td>
   <td>AMG</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>MAX_CONNECTIONS</td>
   <td>The maximum number of simultaneous connections/transfers that the
       AFD allows. Don't set this value to high since some environments
       allow only a limited number of process per user.</td>
   <td>20</td>
   <td>FD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>REMOTE_FILE_CHECK_INTERVAL</td>
   <td>The interval in second that the FD rescans remote directories for
       files. Do not set this value to low.</td>

   <td>FD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>DEFAULT_AGE_LIMIT</td>
   <td>Files older then the given seconds will be deleted by default,
       unless the age-limit is specified under options, then this
       value will be taken.</td>
   <td>0</td>
   <td>FD</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>MAX_COPIED_FILES</td>
   <td>The maximum number of files that are copied before they are
       send to the FD. This value is set so that the AFD starts sending
       files as soon as possible even when there are thousands of files
       waiting in the source directory to be send. Otherwise it might
       take to long to process all the files at once and time is lost
       that could be used to transmit data.</td>
   <td>100</td>
   <td>AMG</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>MAX_COPIED_FILE_SIZE</td>
   <td>The maximum size in Megabytes that are copied before they are
       send to the FD.</td>

<tr>
   <td>ONE_DIR_COPY_TIMEOUT</td>
   <td>When AMG has collected MAX_COPIED_FILES, it will try to continue to
       copy from this directory until it reaches the timeout set by this
       option in seconds.</td>

   <td>AMG</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>DIR_CHECK_TIMEOUT</td>
   <td>When the administrator has marked one or more directories as

   <td>This option allows the administrator to allow certain users
       to take up another identity, even if they do not exist on the
       system. This user will then be used to look up the permissions
       in the <a href="afd_users.html">afd.users</a> file. So if you for
       example give operators limited permission and do not want to
       create a new user, you can do the following:
       <pre>
             FAKE_USER     afd->operator
       </pre>
       If the user afd enters the following command:
       <pre>
             afd_ctrl -u operator
       </pre>
       the afd_ctrl dialog will come up with the permissions of
       operator.</td>

When one of the above values is changed the appropriate process must be
restarted.
