   <TD valign=top> Q.
   <TD>The network connection to ALL hosts is down. What should be done?
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> A.
   <TD>Watch the job queue counter. If it reaches the value of approximately
       800, stop the AMG. But it does not hurt if you stop the AMG
       immediately. No files will be lost.
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> Q.
   <TD>The connection to one host is down and the job queue counter is
       constantly increasing. What action is necessary?
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> A.
   <TD>Actually no action is necessary. Since the AFD will itself stop
       the queue for this host if it reaches any critical value (and it
       will automatically reactivate the queue when everything is okay
       again). But it also does not hurt when you stop the queue for this
       host. But don't forget to turn it on again!
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> Q.
   <TD>When a connection to one host is down for a few hours and the job
       queue counter does not reach a critical value, should I stop
       the transfer or queue.
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> A.
   <TD>No action is necessary. The FD will try to connect to the host in
       regular intervals.
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> Q.
   <TD>An error has occurred for connection XYZ. How do you know what type
       of error has occurred?
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> A.
   <TD>Look in the Transfer Log file and see what type of error it is.
       If it says "Failed to connect." then it is a network error or the
       remote host is down. Check the network to the remote host. With
       other errors it is best to turn on the debug mode for this host
       and evaluate the output in the Transfer Debug Log.
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> Q.
   <TD>The problem to a host has been solved, but it always takes such a
       long time before it tries to send the files again. How can one test
       immediately whether the problem is solved or not?
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> A.
   <TD> Press the retry button.
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> Q.
   <TD>The password has been changed by the remote user. It has been
       updated in the local DIR_CONFIG file, but it still fails to send
       files to the remote host!
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> A.
   <TD>The message that is causing this error still has the old password.
       Go into the message directory find the message with the incorrect
       password, correct it and then press the <A HREF="afd_ctrl.html#"Retry">
       Retry button</A>.
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> Q.
   <TD>There is no response or action at all. Even starting or stopping the
       AMG or FD does nothing. What's wrong?
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD valign=top> A.
   <TD>Most properly the AFD was not shutdown correctly. Log out of the
       afd_ctrl and log in again. Be patience this can take a while
       (up to 30s) because every time you call the program afd it will check
       whether there is an AFD already running. If not it will restart the AFD.
       All other programs and shared memory areas will be removed.
