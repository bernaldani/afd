   <TD>1yz</TD>
   <TD>Positive Preliminary Reply</TD>
   <TD>The requested action is being initiated; expect another
       reply before proceeding with a new command.  (The
       user-process sending another command before the
       completion reply would be in violation of protocol; but
       server-FTP processes should queue any commands that
       arrive while a preceding command is in progress.)  This
       type of reply can be used to indicate that the command
       was accepted and the user-process may now pay attention
       to the data connections, for implementations where
       simultaneous monitoring is difficult.  The server-FTP
       process may send at most, one 1yz reply per command.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD>2yz</TD>
   <TD>Positive Completion Reply</TD>
   <TD>The requested action has been successfully completed. A
       new request may be initiated.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD>3yz</TD>
   <TD>Positive Intermediate Reply</TD>
   <TD>The command has been accepted, but the requested action
       is being held in abeyance, pending receipt of further
       information.  The user should send another command
       specifying this information.  This reply is used in
       command sequence groups.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD>4yz</TD>
   <TD>Transient Negative Completion Reply</TD>
   <TD>The command was not accepted and the requested action did
       not take place, but the error condition is temporary and
       the action may be requested again.  The user should
       return to the beginning of the command sequence, if any.
       It is difficult to assign a meaning to "transient",
       particularly when two distinct sites (Server- and
       User-processes) have to agree on the interpretation.
       Each reply in the 4yz category might have a slightly
       different time value, but the intent is that the
       user-process is encouraged to try again.  A rule of thumb
       in determining if a reply fits into the 4yz or the 5yz
       (Permanent Negative) category is that replies are 4yz if
       the commands can be repeated without any change in
       command form or in properties of the User or Server
       (e.g., the command is spelled the same with the same
       arguments used; the user does not change his file access
       or user name; the server does not put up a new
       implementation.)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD>5yz</TD>
   <TD>Permanent Negative Completion Reply</TD>
   <TD>The command was not accepted and the requested action did
       not take place.  The User-process is discouraged from
       repeating the exact request (in the same sequence).  Even
       some "permanent" error conditions can be corrected, so
       the human user may want to direct his User-process to
       reinitiate the command sequence by direct action at some
       point in the future (e.g., after the spelling has been
       changed, or the user has altered his directory status.)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
   <TD>x0z</TD>
   <TD>Syntax Error</TD>
   <TD>These replies refer to syntax errors,
       syntactically correct commands that don't fit any
       functional category, unimplemented or superfluous
       commands.</TD>
</TR>

   <TD>x1z</TD>
