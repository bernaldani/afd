Development of the AFD started at the beginning of 1995 when the DWD decided
that it needs a software that distributes files via FTP to its international
partners. The first operational AFD was used on a Stratus Continuum Model 620
under FTX 3.0.0.1 in February 1996. In May 1997 the DWD decided to use the
AFD to distribute its data on a national basis. Since then over 76 AFD's have
been installed in Germany. Needless to say that lots of changes and bug
fixes where made since the first version of the AFD:
