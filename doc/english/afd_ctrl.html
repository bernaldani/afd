<P>
To control and monitor the AFD there is an X11 interface, with the
following appearance:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/afd_ctrl_labeled.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
As shown this dialog is divided into four main areas: menu, heading, connection
and status.
</P>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="menu"><U>Menu</U></A></CENTER></H3>
<P>
The menu area has five pull down buttons: Host, View, Control and Setup.
If your afd_ctrl window does not have all buttons shown and described here,
then the system administrator did not allow you to use this function.

<UL>
   <LI><B>Start/Stop queue</B> allows you to start or stop the queue of one
       or more selected hosts. When the queue is stopped the queue led
       turns brown.</LI>
   <LI><B>Start/Stop transfer</B> allows you to start or stop the transfer
       of one or more selected hosts. When the transfer is stopped the
       transfer led will be orange. Stopping the transfer means that
       messages are still being generated, but the FD will not distribute
       the files.
       Care should be taken when choosing this option. Watch the job queue
       number so it does not reach a critical stage. Use start/stop queue
       if lots of files are being distributed for this alias.</LI>
   <LI>When you want to stop a host and do not want to collect the data for
       it, disable it by pressing the <B>Enable/Disable host</B> button.
       NOTE: All current jobs for this host will be deleted when disabling
       a host.</LI>
   <LI><A NAME="Switch host"><B>Switch host</B></A> allows to change the
       destination address of selected hosts. To see whether a certain host
       has a secondary address look in
       <A HREF="afd_info.html">afd_info dialog</A>.</LI>
   <LI><A NAME="Retry"><B>Retry</B></A> can only be used when the error
       counter (ec) is larger then zero. It is useful when you do not want
       to wait for the automatic retry of the AFD, i.e. you want to speed
       things up.</LI>
   <LI>If an error has occurred, or you wish to see what is happening during
       a transmission, press the <B>Debug</B> button. To watch the output
       you will have to open the Transfer Debug Log window by pressing on
       the <A HREF="#Transfer_Debug_Log">Transfer Debug Log button</A>. The
       contents of the output log is described in <A HREF="log.html#transfer_debug_log">

   <LI><B>Configuration</B> shows the DIR_CONFIG configuration of the

   <LI><B>Exit</B> will close the afd_ctrl window and all other windows that
