<hr size=3 noshade>
<p>
The second configuration file for the AFD is used to do a configuration
by host name. There can be as many entries as you want and it must
not always have a corresponding host name in the DIR_CONFIG file or
visa versa. This file consists of a table with 15 entries for each
host. See below for a description of each entry.

<table>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="alias_hostname">Alias hostname</a></th>
   <td>The alias host name. This is the host name that is being displayed
       in the afd_ctrl window and is used in the log files. If a secondary
       host can be specified, ignore the toggling characters, ie. when
       the host name in the DIR_CONFIG file is specified as 'host{12}'
       only state 'host' as host name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="real_hostname_1">Real hostname 1</a></th>
   <td>The real host name or IP number of this host. If there is a
       secondary host this will be the primary host, ie. if auto toggle
       is set it will always try to switch back to this address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="real_hostname_2">Real hostname 2</a></th>
   <td>The real host name or IP number of the secondary host. If there
       is no secondary host just don't enter anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="host_toggle">Host toggle</a></th>
   <td>Host switching information. This string holds the toggling
       character to be displayed for the primary and secondary host.
       The two characters must be put in either curly brackets {} for
       automatic host switching or square brackets [] host switching
       by the user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="proxy_name">Proxy name</a></th>
   <td>If remote server is a proxy, enter the rule on how to
       enter this proxy here. Currently you can only specify the
       order of the user name and the password. To enter the
       user name just enter $U&lt;user name&gt; and the password
       is entered with $P&lt;password&gt;. You may specify as
       many user and password elments as you want, each one must
       however be separated by a ;. If you only put a $U followed
       directly by a ; it will take the user name from the recipient
       entry. The same goes for the password. If the remote server
       requires the ACCT (account) directive instead of the USER
       to enter the login name you may also use $A instead of $U.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="allowed_transfers">Allowed Transfers</a></th>
   <td>The maximum number of parallel transfers for this host. On very
       slow connection it is best to allow just one. The default here is
       two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="max_errors">Max. Errors</a></th>
   <td>If max. errors is reached the destination identifier turns 'red'.
       If error retries reaches twice max. errors the queue of this host
       will be paused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="retry_interval">Retry Interval</a></th>
   <td>If an error occurs, this is the delay (in seconds) before another
       transfer is initiated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="transfer_block_size">Transfer Block Size</a></th>
   <td>The size of the blocks being used to send files to the remote host
       (in Bytes). Maximum value is 65536 and minimum is 256. Default
       value is 4096 (DEFAULT_TRANSFER_BLOCKSIZE).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="sucessful_retries">Successful Retries</a></th>
   <td>This is the number of sucessful retries to the secondary host
       before it will try to send to the original host to see if it
       has become available again. If a value of less then one is specified
       it will NOT try to go back to the original host. It will from
       then on always send to the secondary host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="file_size_offset">File Size Offset</a></th>
   <td>When transmitting large files and the transfer gets interrupted, the
       AFD can append a file on the remote site. For this it needs to know
       the file size on the remote site. And to get the size it does a dir
       'filename' at the remote site. Due to different replies of the FTP
       servers, the position of the file size is needed. You can easily
       determine this value simply doing an FTP to the remote site and a
       dir and count the spaces to the file size. For example:
       <pre>
     -rw-r--r--   1 afd      mts-soft   14971 Jan  3 17:16
               ^^^ ^   ^^^^^^        ^^^
                |  |     |            |
                |  |     |            |
                1  2     3            4
       </pre>
       i.e. the file size offset is 4. Or if the remote site supports
       the SITE command you can select -2. Then the remote site will
       tell AFD what the current size is. This seems to be also much
       more reliable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="transfer_timeout">Transfer Timeout</a></th>
   <td>The time (in seconds) how long the AFD should wait for a reply from
       the remote site (default 120).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="number_of_no_burst">Number of no bursts</a></th>
   <td>This option applies only to FTP transfers. A burst is when a new job
       is appended to a transferring job. It can happen that jobs get
       constantly appended while other jobs with a higher priority have
       to wait. Therefore it is possible to state the number of connections
       that may NOT burst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <th valign=top><a name="host_status">Host status</a></th>
   <td>This indicates the status of the host, currently only bits number
       1, 2 and 6 can be set. The meaning is as follows:
       <table border>
       <tr>
          <th>Bit number</th>
          <th>Integer value</th>
          <th>What it does</th>

          <td>If set transfer is stopped for this host.</td>
       </tr>
       </table>
       The default is zero.</td>
