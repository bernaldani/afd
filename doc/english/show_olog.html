All files that have been transmitted by the AFD, can be viewed
with the help of this dialog (see <a href="log.html#output_log">Output Log</a>).
However, only those files will be shown where the option
<a href="amg.html#no_log_output">no log output</a> was <b>NOT</b> set.
This option is commonly used to reduce the overhead caused by logging.
Since the output log can be very extensive, there are lots of possibility
to reduce the search time by filling in some of the following values:
</p>
<center><img src="../images/output_log_selection.gif" alt="[closeup of selection part]"></center>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Enter the start and end time of the search. If no value is entered
       it will always take the earliest or latest entries it finds. There
       are two time forms. One is the absolute and the other is the
       relative time format. The following absolute forms are possible:
       MMDDhhmm, DDhhmm and hhmm (MM = month [01-12], DD = day [01-31],
       hh = hour [00 - 23], mm = minute [00 - 59]). The relative form
       always starts with a hyphen '-' and has the following format:
       -DDHhhmm, -hhmm or -mm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Shows the current date and time in the following format:
       DD.MM.YYYY hh:mm</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>3</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Enter a file name. The name may have any number of the two following
       wild cards: * and ?. If no file name or wild card is entered it will
       always search for all file names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>4</b>&nbsp;</tD>
   <td>Here it is possible to enter the length/size of a file. If a &lt; or
       a &gt; sign it will search for files less then or greater then the
       given size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>5</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The source directory where the AFD has picked up the file. Even here
       it is possible to enter wild cards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>6</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Here you can enter a remote host name and only files that where
       send to this host will be shown. It is also possible to enter more
       then one host, by separating the hosts with a comma. Wild cards
       can also be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>7</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Here it is possible to select by the protocol they where transmitted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>8</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>These toggle buttons allow the user to toggle between different length
       of the file name in the list box. The short one is useful when
       printing on A4 paper.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary to fill in any values, however then the search might
take a very long time for it to finish, depending on how long and how many
log files there are. While the dialog is searching for data, the function
of the search button changes into a stop button, enabling the user to
interrupt the search. This button and the slider of the list widget are the
only buttons that are active during a search. Thus, the user can search in
the list widget by using the slider, while the dialog is still searching.
Once a search is interrupted, the search will always start from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Here follows a short description of the list widgets and the meaning of
each item:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/output_log_list.gif" alt="[closeup of the list field]"></center>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>Date</td>
   <td>The date in the following format: MM.DD. where MM is the month
       (01-12) and DD is the day of the month (01-31).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Time</td>
   <td>The time in the following format: hh:mm:ss where hh is the hour
       (00-23), mm is the minute (00-59) and ss is the second (00-59).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>File name</td>
   <td>The file name as it was distributed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Hostname</td>
   <td>The host name of the remote host.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Type</td>
   <td>The protocol with which this file was distributed. Currently there
       are three protocols: FTP, SMTP and LOC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>File size</td>
   <td>The size of the distributed file in bytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>TT</td>
   <td>Transfer time. This is the time taken for this file to be
       transmitted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>A</td>
   <td>Archive flag. If there is a Y it means that this file has been
       archived. Note however that when the archive time is reached
       this file will be deleted. Thus this flag will only indicate
       if this file was archived or not. If it was not archived you will
       find an N here.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
When the file name is longer then it is shown in the list widget it is
still possible to view it by using the 'AFD info click'. This is done
by pressing the right mouse button while the cursor is over the wanted
item in the list widget. The following window will pop up:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/output_log_info1.gif" alt="[picture of info dialog]"></center>
</p>
<p>
As shown, this window also shows what the entry in the DIR_CONFIG looked
like when this file was send. Thus it is always possible for the AFD
system administrator to see with what options the files are distributed,
regardless how many changes there where in the DIR_CONFIG file.
</p>
<p>
Right under the list widget is a summary line which looks as follows:
</p>
<p>
<center><img src="../images/output_log_summary.gif" alt="[summary line]"></center>
</p>
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>1</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The time in days from the first entry found to the last entry in
       the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The rest time in hours, minutes and seconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>3</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The total number of files found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>4</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The average transfer rate. This is calculated from the values
       found in 6 and 7.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>5</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>The average number of files transmitted. This is calculated from
       the values found in 1, 2 and 3.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>6</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Total number of bytes transfered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>&nbsp;<b>7</b>&nbsp;</td>
   <td>Total time used for transferring the files.</td>
</tr>
