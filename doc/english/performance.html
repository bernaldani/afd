In the DWD lots of small files are being tranported to its custumors.
So the following performance test where done with linking lots of
small from one directory to the other. The test scenario looks as
follows: three AFD's, all in the same file system, send 20000 files
in a loop. The following results where achived:
<UL>
   <LI>Conf. 1:
   <LI>Latest operational release : Version 0.9.15 (03rd March 1998)
   <LI>Top number of files transmitted : 33 Files/second<BR>
       (This was measured when doing test between an SGI
        workstation (ixt1) and a P133 running Linux.)
       In another test where files where copied localy, the AFD managed
       to handle 90 Files/seconds.
   <LI>On the 28th May 1997 the DWD has decided to use the AFD for
       transmitting its national files.
