<P>
AFD is a program to automatically distributes files either locally
or to remote hosts. AFD stands for Automatic File Distributor.
</P>
<P>
The most common technique used to distribute data is for each individual
to fetch the data from one common place. This place can be a database,
FTP-server or even the WWW (World Wide Web). However, this is not always
the most user or customer friendly way for a company or organization to
distribute its products. For this reason AFD (Automatic File Distributor)
was developed, to provide a better service to users or customers in
transporting the required data directly to the location where it is required.
</P>
<P>
When distributing files to a remote host it does so via the FTP or SMTP
protocol. Local distribution is done by simply copying files from one
directory to another. To distribute files, the AFD has one central
configuration file (DIR_CONFIG), where the system administrator can
specify which files are to be distributed and where they are to be send.
</P>
<P>
Here follows a list of features of the AFD:
</P>
<UL>
   <LI>The AFD can send any type of file, regardless of contents
       and the name of the file.</LI>
   <LI>Only the files are being distributed, no other additional
       information is send with the file.</LI>
   <LI>The AFD has a very sophisticated and compact X11 interface to
       monitor and control the distribution of files. It
       has the ability to do extensive logging of all activities, even
       down to tracing each individual FTP/SMTP command.</LI>
   <LI>Files can be send to places where no AFD is installed.</LI>
   <LI>There can be more than one process distributing files to
       a single host. This has the advantage that when a large
       file is currently being distributed, other files don't
       have to wait until the large file is done.</LI>
   <LI>Where net capacity is limited, it is possible to distribute
       files with priority.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The AFD requires X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x (or higher). Currently it has
been ported to the following systems:
</P>
<UL>
   <LI>Linux  1.3.x&nbsp; - &nbsp;2.2.x</LI>
   <LI>Sun-OS 5.3</LI>
   <LI>HP-UX  10.x</LI>
   <LI>IRIX   5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;6.x</LI>
   <LI>FTX    3.0.x&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.x</LI>
   <LI>SCO    OpenServer Release 5</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The AFD is now for more than four years in operational use at the DWD at
over 76 installations distributing two million files (120 Gbytes) daily
and is administrated by a single person.
