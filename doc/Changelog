             the hostname this will be called with the parameter 'start'.
             If the error condition went away it will be called with the

             of the filename. Having the rule "*_1 *" and the name
             a_1_222_1 would result in "a" and not "a_1_222". Fixed.
15.05.2005 - Fix sending files by mail with xsend_file dialog via
             show_olog and show_queue.
18.05.2005 - Added new options sohetx, wmo and sohetxwmo to convert
             option.
08.06.2005 - When searching for next file group in DIR_CONFIG we did

17.06.2005 - lookup_dir_id() always had one byte for CRC calculation
             that was not initialized, thus always generating different
             CRC's for the same directory name.
25.06.2005 - Added --enable-group_can_write to configure to enable
             group write access to fifo. This makes setuid bit for
             some layouts unnecessary.
01.07.2005 - If no configuration is found install some defaults.
           - Workaround for IIS FTP-server bug, disabled by default.

             conditions.
13.09.2005 - Handle the error case 'connection reset by peer' better.
14.09.2005 - At a certain point error jobs will now age much more
             quickly the more retries there have been.
19.09.2005 - If we fail to open system log fifo set file descriptor to
             STDERR_FILENO.

             also have the SETUID bit set.
21.09.2005 - Added option "sequence locking".
           - When updating DIR_CONFIG and a retrieving job has been
             removed, it could happen that other retrieving jobs that
             terminate would write to the wrong position in FRA.
22.09.2005 - sf_xxx deleted files that had dates in the future when
             age limit was set. Fixed.

             mon_ctrl dialog.
02.10.2005 - Dialog dir_info now shows all directory options.
03.10.2005 - Function check_fra_fd() incremented a wrong variable when
             a retrieve job was removed. Fixed.
           - If we kill a retrieve job that has just been removed from
             DIR_CONFIG, remove its zombie too.
05.10.2005 - In FRA remember what was in DIR_CONFIG. This helps
             to make a better reconstruction of DIR_CONFIG with command
             line tool get_dc_data.
09.10.2005 - When doing a scp transfer, show correct colors in job
             details dialog.
10.10.2005 - Function get_dir_options() would some times list every
             single minute, instead of a single *. Fixed.
15.10.2005 - Option to force a rescan of a directory where time option
             is set in [dir options] in afdcmd and dir_ctrl.
16.10.2005 - Font for menu 'Search + (De)Select' was not changed when
             we changed the font for the dir_ctrl dialog.
           - New parameter for afdcmd to enable/disable a directory.
17.10.2005 - Added event handler to error host list in mon_ctrl dialog
             to close this list if we click on it or move mouse cursor
             away from it.
           - Dialog show_ilog can now also search for files that are
             retrieved from a remote host.
28.10.2005 - New AFD_CONFIG option REMOVE_UNUSED_HOSTS to remove unused
             hosts from the FSA.

           - For acceleration keys in afd_ctrl, dir_ctrl and mon_ctrl
             dialog allow user to change Alt+<Key> combination to
             Ctrl+<Key> with the configure option:
                  --enable-with_ctrl_accelerator
14.11.2005 - Update next check time in FD even when retrieving is
             disabled.
21.11.2005 - In check_file_dir() check if the directory actually
             contains files. If not just silently (just debug) delete
             the directory.
22.11.2005 - From dir_ctrl dialog selecting one or more directories
             will now show up in show_ilog, show_olog and show_dlog
             dialog.
           - In httpcmd.c we may not send an empty line in the HTTP
             header. This always happens if there is no authentication.
             Fixed.
24.11.2005 - Sometimes some jobs get handled twice by FD. This is because
             there is a small time frame where both FD and AMG think they
             are the only process in control of the message queue. This
             is hopefully fixed by adding more locking at critical
             moments.
28.11.2005 - When attaching to FSA or FRA we do not check if the
             current code is able to handle the stored version. This
             should catch the case when someone uses new binaries
             without restarting AFD or mixing old and new binaries.
29.11.2005 - With rename option when files would overwrite each other
             AFD would per default append a ; and a number to the name.
             The ';' has now been changed to a '-'. Reason is that
             some FTP-servers do not allow this and under *nix is
             a bit odd to handle.
30.11.2005 - When opening job details window, do not resize the main
             window, just the popup window.
06.12.2005 - Some Motif versions need -lXp, configure should now detect
             this. This is needed for debian with openmotif.
07.12.2005 - If we try send the data from some log output to some email
             address and we fail because we do not have write permission,
             retry this time using /tmp.
           - asmtp failed to separate mail header from message body.
             Fixed.
08.12.2005 - When calling remote commands via mon_ctrl, make full path
             to the rafdd_cmd/rafdd_cmd_ssh script optional.

15.12.2005 - When specifying a / in time option in any of the possible
             field, except for min field, could lead to AMG going into
             an endless loop.

             one second (leap second).
02.01.2006 - Made handling of pty devices more compatible with more
             systems.
06.01.2006 - Empty pool directories are not deleted because we failed
             to take into account that the directory ID was written in
             hex. Fixed.
           - The view_dc dialog now shows the correct directory options
             again.
           - The tool get_dc_data can now show directory options.
08.01.2006 - Don't check each possible return string after we entered
             the password for a SSH connection.

             but user cannot read the file for whatever reason.
09.03.2006 - Support for duplicate checks on a per host basis.
           - In function check_files() we must remove a CRC from

             correct permissions, we failed to check for supplementary
             groups.
16.03.2006 - Implemented group transfer limit.
21.03.2006 - When doing pexec show what command we currently execute
             in the job details window.

11.04.2006 - For protocol SCP and when we are doing a burst we must
             also check if the target directories are the same. Since
             SCP protocol does not support changing directories.
19.04.2006 - Dialog dir_info, show_ilog, show_olog, show_dlog and
             show_queue did not work when fake user was used from
             dir_ctrl.
           - The option tiff2gts can now handle other TIFF files with
             WMO headers not only DWD special scanner files. Thanks
             to Laurentiu BROJBOIU!
           - Fix some errors in show_ilog dialog not showing any or
             all data.

------------------------> Released: 05.07.2006 <---------------------------



----------------------------> Version 1.3.4 <------------------------------
                             ---------------
20.07.2006 - Added option 'convert mrz2wmo', to convert GRIB, BUFR, BLOK
             files to WMO files (10 byte length/type indicator plus
             SOH and ETX at start and end).
23.07.2006 - SFTP and SCP can both now take the host fingerprint and
             handle the known_hosts file.
           - Option -T for show_stat and show_istat to just show numeric
             total values.
27.07.2006 - Process afdd now sends some statistic data to afd_mon.
02.08.2006 - For the option 'file name is header' allow for a dot being
             the end of the header information.
05.08.2006 - Enhanced option 'subject' to allow for inserting the
             filename or part of it.
06.08.2006 - Updated optimization option for gcc compiler for newer CPU's.
           - Added option --enable-compiler-security to add gcc security
             features.
08.08.2006 - When a retrieve job is removed by hand, it would always
             popup in the queue again, because we forgot to calculate
             a new fetch time.
09.08.2006 - Error jobs for retrieve jobs where not aging in the queue.
             Fixed.
           - Added LIST_ERROR to the errors where we need to apply aging.
12.08.2006 - Added extended commands EPRT and EPSV for FTP.
17.08.2006 - Implemented for HTTP fetching to continue an interrupted
             download where it stopped just before the interrupt.
18.08.2006 - Added handling of directory listing for HTTP. Currently
             we can handle only a few listings from Apache web servers.
             More will be added.
20.08.2006 - For the option 'store remote list' added parameter 'once'
             to retrieve files only once. This is useful for directories
             with lots of files and when the protocol forces us to poll
             each individual file for any changes in modification time
             and/or size.
23.08.2006 - Made directory option 'store remote list' now also work
             for local directories. For this reason the option is renamed
             to 'store retrieve list'. The old option name will still
             work for a while, but will eventually be removed.
24.08.2006 - Added option DELETE_STALE_ERROR_JOBS in AFD_CONFIG to
             remove error jobs queued that are no longer in DIR_CONFIG.
26.08.2006 - Implemented persistent connection for retrieving files.
27.08.2006 - Close an unneeded file descriptor in process AMG.
28.08.2006 - get_dc_data and dialog view_dc can now show all data when
             a host alias is used for retrieving and sending.
19.09.2006 - The extract option now can handle parameters which can handle
             if SOH and ETX is added or not, a CRC checksum is added to
             the filename and/or a unique number is added to the filename.
20.09.2006 - Proftpd server does not send a reply to NLST command when
             directory is empty. Added a workaround.
24.09.2006 - Show the number of directories scanned on a daily basis.
27.09.2006 - If the text in the mail body had a leading dot, AFD did
             not add another dot as specified in RFC 821. Fixed.
28.09.2006 - Added option to make trans_rename apply only for primary or
             secondary host.
           - When showing information in the show_queue dialog, show
             the directory alias of a job.
29.09.2006 - When disabling a directory and it is one retrieving files
             from a remote host, we need to remove the job from the queue
             in process FD.
05.10.2006 - Added configure option --enable-multi_dir_scans for systems
             that do not update the modification time of the scanned
             directory correctly.
16.10.2006 - The view_dc dialog sometimes shows garbage at the end. Fixed.
20.10.2006 - Function check_file_dir() will delete all files or directories
             of a job when they start with a leading dot and the job is
             done.
23.10.2006 - In the URI it is now possible to specify the SSH protocol
             to be used for SFTP or SCP with the help of protocol= option.
28.10.2006 - Selecting a directory and then calling show_ilog, show_olog
             show_dlog and/or show_queue did not work from the dir_ctrl
             dialog. Fixed.
30.10.2006 - Accept " when specifying the file name for option 'mail header'.
31.10.2006 - When we fail to create a directory or even when we do not
             have sufficient permissions, we now accept it. Before we just
             ignored this directory. This behavior had the disadvantage
             that one always had to restart AFD once the directory was
             added.
06.11.2006 - When the host alias name is equal or longer then
             MAX_HOSTNAME_LENGTH (8), don't put the switching number/letter
             at end when logging in TRANSFER_LOG.
07.11.2006 - Renaming for options "attach file" and "attach all files" did
             not work. Fixed.
           - Implemented an error queue that stores the job ID's of broken
             (ie. those that do not work) jobs. So if for example the remote
             directory of one job is not available, but another job with
             another working directory to the same destination, will no
             longer be blocked.
08.11.2006 - Dialog afd_ctrl could crash when a parallel transfer was added
             or removed from a host. Fixed.
           - In rename.rule allow user to specify rules with spaces.
09.11.2006 - The send button in show_olog and show_queue dialog did not
             work for other users under certain conditions. Fixed.
           - If dialogs cannot open $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/afd.users file due to
             permissions, give out some more meaningful messages.
           - When process FD is stopped it must ensure that sending process
             do not leave behind any empty directories.
10.11.2006 - New directory option 'warn time', to warn user when the
             directory has not received any data for the specified time.
             This will be shown by the middle bar in the dir_ctrl dialog.
13.11.2006 - Allow for multiple time entries under options.
14.11.2006 - Show queued time jobs in show_queue dialog.
16.11.2006 - Corrected some errors in AFD init script when having multiple
             users configured.
17.11.2006 - Make creation of source directories in AFD_CONFIG configurable.
18.11.2006 - Function calc_next_time() did not calculate the correct time
             when the current minute was 59. Fixed.
21.11.2006 - tr and fr fields where swapped in dir_ctrl dialog. Fixed.
13.12.2006 - Fix an error in "extract ASCII" that could lead to a crash
             of process dir_check.
20.12.2006 - Implemented no last suffix option for dupcheck option.
10.01.2007 - If AFD is already stopped do not return a -1 when doing
             a 'afd -s' or 'afd -S' it now returns a 10. This makes it
             possible to detect if AFD was shutdown properly.
08.02.2007 - Added afdcfg option to enable or disable 'warn time' for
             directories.
23.02.2007 - Specifying the parameter '-a -2' for program aftp did not
             work since it thought that the -2 is a new option.
25.02.2007 - Fix a memory leak in process dir_check when the host alias
             order is changed with edit_hc dialog.
27.02.2007 - For HTTPS guard SSL_read() from blocking, since we are using
             SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY.
01.03.2007 - Give user the option to disable bursting on a per host basis.
06.03.2007 - Function check_fsa_entries() did not reset the queue flag in
             FRA when it was resetting this.
15.03.2007 - The dir alias name was truncated to 8 characters when calling
             show_istat with a dir alias as parameter. Fixed.
23.03.2007 - Fix an error in show_istat which could lead to wrong sums.
           - When using passive FTP ignore the remote IP part, only
             take the port.
24.03.2007 - Finish implementing of collecting all log data by afd_mon
             from monitored AFD's.
27.03.2007 - When doing a burst and duplicate check is enabled we must
             pass on the number of retries, otherwise when we do the
             duplicate check will delete data that we still need to send.
------------------------> Released: 27.03.2007 <---------------------------



----------------------------> Version 1.3.5 <------------------------------
                             ---------------
31.03.2007 - Process FD could crash if it removed file filters from the
             internal database due to an error in function init_msg_buffer().
           - When starting AFD via 'afd -a' it must wait until init_afd
             has started up, otherwise starting AFD via init script
             (/etc/init.d/afd) might not start after a system crash.
01.04.2007 - Fix an error in pmatch() and sfilter() function where they

             as well, not just the keyboard.
           - Did not compile with --disable-dupcheck_support. Fixed.
13.04.2007 - When afdd has no log data to send it sends empty log data
             at regular intervals.

29.06.2007 - When updating DIR_CONFIG it could happen that certain retrieve
             jobs would no longer work until FD was restarted. An additional
             check was added that tries to detect such a situation and
             correct it automatically.
01.07.2007 - Do not calculate a new directory scan time if the directory
             was full.
04.07.2007 - Changed meaning of show_dlog and show_elog in afd.users file.

             another program.
26.07.2007 - When using server= and the name specified is only an alias,
             process sf_smtp would try to connect to this alias. Fixed.
08.08.2007 - For the dialog where you can select event actions, added a
             button to toggle all events.
           - When allocating memory for storing file names from a
             directory, don't set this to the full value specified by
             the user (max files) at once. Allocate it in hunks until we
             reach the maximum specified by the user.
           - For show_olog, instead of printing directly to the printer
             (via redirecting the output), write to a file and then print

31.08.2007 - When checking if another AFD is active make the timeout
             tuneable via command line argument.
           - Possibly fix SIGBUS error of process afdd when rereading
             DIR_CONFIG.
02.09.2007 - Added splice() support in copy_file() and to sf_loc to
             reduce system load.
04.09.2007 - Remove a race condition from error queue that could lead
             to a host with an error queue always set.
           - If a job is no longer in DIR_CONFIG, immediately remove
             it from the error queue.

             the error queue set.
09.09.2007 - Speedup function archive_file(), by removing some unnecessary
             system calls and/or replacing them by more efficient calls.
10.09.2007 - When bursting a job of the same job ID we must recheck if
             error queue flag is set. Otherwise it can happen that we
             service a job that is in error queue but do not unset it after
             being done.
           - Process afd_mon always tries to restart log_mon for a

             list is no longer in order. Fixed.
13.09.2007 - When multiple DIR_CONFIG's are defined in AFD_CONFIG, show
             the full path of the DIR_CONFIG to which the job belongs
             when viewing the configuration for a host.
20.09.2007 - Added script afd_unused_infos to show, delete or move unused
             INFO-* files.
21.09.2007 - When directory option 'ignore size' or 'ignore file time' is
             set and the option 'delete unknown files' is set, it will
             delete those files if the size or time do not match.
           - The button 'Attach file' was not correctly attached in the
             xsend_file dialog so it was not visible. Fixed.
           - In xsend_file dialog entering a mail server had no effect.
             Fixed.
           - A directory scan that does not find any files is now
             reported in RECEIVE_LOG. This can be disabled with the

29.09.2007 - Implemented persistent connection for transmitting files.
           - To much valuable time is lost when FD is catching its
             zombies. By inserting a zombie queue FD can now spawn
             much faster new process.
           - Show a message when someone tries to do a retry of a
             stopped or disabled host that this is not possible.
10.10.2007 - Fetching files via HTTP together with the directory option
             'do not get dir list' did not work with file filters having
             %t modifier and other modifiers. Fixed.
03.11.2007 - Added option to use scheme file if the hostname matches with
             the nodname on which AFD is running.
08.11.2007 - Added configuration file 'local_interface.list' where one
             can configure local interfaces so AFD can use scheme file
             on those interfaces.
10.11.2007 - Dialog afd_info shows in the protocol line if it is active,
             passive or extended active/passive mode.
16.11.2007 - When changing the name of the host alias, it could happen
             that no more files get distributed for the new host alias
             name.
23.11.2007 - Process dir_check will now continue to try scan a directory
             once it was not accessible.
------------------------> Released: 26.11.2007 <---------------------------



----------------------------> Version 1.4.0 <------------------------------
                             ---------------
30.11.2007 - Program asmtp did not send the correct subject identifier.
           - Dialog xsend_file sends an incorrect mail address.
02.12.2007 - When keep_alive is set, take timeout - 5 as the interval
             time at which to send the stat command.

             alias names.
           - Dialog show_queue shows wrong directory when called with
             selection from dir_ctrl dialog if directory identifier is
             larger then 31 bits.
11.12.2007 - For some unknown reasons it can happen that afd_ctrl dialog
             calculates the wrong position of a line causing it to show
             a warning popup each time the mouse pointer enters the dialog.
             Added some more checks in the code to catch this case.
13.12.2007 - Stopping afd_mon via mafd command line returns -1 when it
             was already stopped. It should return 10, so it does not
             confuse heartbeat.

             mail header file do exist and are readable.
09.01.2008 - Some older SSH servers return success when changing into a
             non-existing directory. Added a workaround for such older

24.02.2008 - In mon_ctrl and dir_ctrl dialog draw to off-screen pixmap to
             simply and speedup redrawing after an expose event.

             logged in DELETE_LOG where incorrect. Fixed.
26.02.2008 - If one sets the maximum number of log files to 1 in AFD_CONFIG,
             the log files are then never truncated, ie. they would
             increase in size forever. Fixed.
28.02.2008 - Due to an error dialogs show_ilog, show_olog and show_olog did
             not show directory options. Fixed.
           - The information window of show_ilog and show_dlog now only
             shows matching information, not information of some other
             job that does not apply.
           - Adapted dialog show_dlog to the new DELETE_LOG format.
02.03.2008 - Checking the file directory for jobs without messages is
             now done by dir_check.

05.03.2008 - Added chmod option to command line tool aftp.
           - New dupcheck type that checks filename and size.
08.03.2008 - If keep connected is set for a fetching job and no time
             option is specified under [dir options], then keep
             connected will not work.
           - If DIR_CONFIG is updated all fetching process (gf_*) would

12.03.2008 - When last entry in etc/group.list is not terminated by a
             newline the sf_smtp process would crash. Fixed.
19.03.2008 - The ssh code did not handle banners send by the remote ssh
             daemon correctly. It always think that the remote server
             denied connection. Fixed.
25.03.2008 - Implemented log analyzer tool (alda) to search local logs.
31.03.2008 - When process fd starts it now checks if the positions in

10.04.2008 - Added extract ZCZC.
17.04.2008 - Removed unnecessary restriction that file names may only

05.02.2009 - If the source directory is not in the same file system as
             AFD and the permissions of AFD are such that it may not
             delete the files, AFD would always copy all files from
             that directory as soon as a new one arrives. This is now
             fixed by removing the destination file when we fail to
             unlink the source file.
14.02.2009 - If file gets deleted during transmission (age, duplicate
             check, is currently transmitted by other process), it is

             generated by AFD.
06.04.2009 - Process afdd now takes the bytes send values from each
             individual job. This gives more realistic numbers in
             mon_ctrl dialog.
07.04.2009 - When taking CREATE_SOURCE_DIR_MODE from AFD_CONFIG, convert
             this value to integer from octal. Thanks to Tan Xiaoh

             viewing information of a file deleted. Fixed.
11.04.2009 - Implemented warn time for a host alias. That is when for
             a given host no data has been send or received in the
             specified time, it will be orange in afd_ctrl dialog and
             if an action is specified, this will be executed.

             files are send into the wrong target directory. Fixed.
09.05.2009 - To further reduce the locking overhead, we now accumulate
             lockable data and commit this data at every
             LOCK_INTERVAL_TIME (1 second) interval.
10.05.2009 - When doing a shutdown check if we really are on the host
             where AFD is active.

             and the job is restarted, the pexec is then ignored.
             Fixed.
18.07.2009 - In afd_ctrl dialog we can now also search by protocol, not
             just by name.
24.07.2009 - set_pw can now also set passwords in a directory URL string.
06.08.2009 - Added support for starting and stopping a directory.

17.09.2009 - Process afdd may not use write() system call to write
             128KiB in one hunk on a socket. Use writen() in case the
             writes are segmented.
21.09.2009 - Ensure that one cannot set transfer blocksize to zero in
             HOST_CONFIG.
29.09.2009 - Added option to keep the time stamp of the source file.

             up any host which used protocol SFTP. Fixed.
24.04.2010 - Added option -H to extract option, to remove the WMO
             header.
30.04.2010 - Fix two errors in accumulate directory options. One that
             it was not initialized correctly when it set for the
             first time with a new directory in DIR_CONFIG. The other
             error was that if the source file is of zero length.
19.05.2010 - set_pw did not always set the password if the passwd
             for a source needed to be set. Fixed.
20.05.2010 - When afdcmd starts, stops, enables or disables it should
             do this in an atomic manner. It just toggled the flag, so
             if the command was called twice at the same time the state
             of the flag would not change. Fixed.
26.05.2010 - In edit_hc dialog show correct Transfer Blocksize.
10.06.2010 - Fix error extract_cus(), that caused delete logs with
             incorrect information.
30.06.2010 - Close output log cache files if process output_log is
             not busy.
05.07.2010 - If SSH server sets attribute bit, ignore it but take
             into account that we have read 4 bytes. Otherwise further
             communication with SSH server will fail because we are
             off by 4 bytes. MySecureShell sets this and AFD fails
             to communicate with it. Fixed.
26.08.2010 - show_olog did not allow user to view data even when the
             option view_data was set in $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/afd.users.
             Fixed.
05.10.2010 - Added editing function to the afd_info dialog.
12.10.2010 - Reset FTP server reply when we reconnect when changing
             user.
           - Remove SSH option FallBackToRsh it has been removed from
             openssh for a long enough time. In case it is still
             required one can enable it at compile time by setting
             _WITH_FALLBACK_TO_RSH_NO in afdsetup.h.
13.10.2010 - Added %T time modifier for option subject.
           - If starting of AFD is blocked via 'afd -b', handle this
             properly in afd init script.
19.10.2010 - Make init scripts more LSB conform.
------------------------> Released: 20.10.2010 <---------------------------

                             ---------------
21.10.2010 - Added option BINARY to extract option to extract single
             binary data from a bulletin.
           - Fix configure error where it complains about WITH_XPM
             when setting option --with-gui=none.
27.10.2010 - Added convert option iso8859_2ascii to convert german
             Umlaute.
10.11.2010 - Synchronize parent and child when dir_check executes
             something. This kills the bug that you could suddenly
             have two or more dir_checks running doing the same
             thing.
11.11.2010 - Added parameter R, w and W to the %t parameter. See
             documentation for more details.
18.11.2010 - If keep connected is set the fetching process need to
             check if their position in the FSA changes.
25.11.2010 - In function init_msg_buffer() handle the case that the
             structure connection is not yet setup. Otherwise process
             fd will under certain conditions always crash at startup.
26.11.2010 - Do not go into an endless loop when we hit an unknown
             pexec option.
27.11.2010 - When a host is disabled process fd must collect the
             zombies of the process that distributed data.
02.12.2010 - When function check_files() fails to move/copy files
             be more verbose why it failed.
           - Initialize variable correctly in gf_http. Otherwise
             it can sometimes fail with an unknown error.
03.12.2010 - Fix an error where some reports where not extracted
             from a bulletin.
           - Added flag to the HTTP command set to store commands
             that do not work. This helps for example if some
             systems are not able to handle the HEAD command.
14.12.2010 - Fix an important buffer overflow in init_afd. Thanks
             to the brazilian met office (INMET) for helping me
             to fix this!
16.12.2010 - When we fail to create the directory to queue files
             we not to log the files we fail to move in DELETE_LOG.
20.12.2010 - Transfer some log output from system log to transfer
             and receive log.
04.01.2011 - AFD now checks if the port picked for afdd process is
             not in the dynamic port range of the system. On linux
             it will lookup this value in the proc filesystem.
             Thanks to Hermann Schwarting from EBP for the hint.
06.01.2011 - Added search button when viewing DIR_CONFIG data.
18.01.2011 - Added lchmod option to do a local chmod.

             year as well.
25.01.2011 - In dialogs afd_ctrl, dir_ctrl and mon_ctrl one can now
             quickly change the font by pressing ctrl and +/-.

----------------------------> Version 1.4.4 <------------------------------
                             ---------------
04.02.2011 - If we fail to determine the working diretory show how
             we are being called. To disable this just comment out
             #define ARGV_DEBUG in src/common/get_afd_path.c.
07.02.2011 - In RPM handle case when users write from .profile to stdout
             and/or stderr.
           - In Makefile.am do some more cleanups when we do a 'make clean'.

10.02.2011 - Under some Motif versions the summary line at the bottom
             of some dialogs was not shown if the font selected was
             very small. Fixed.
11.02.2011 - Speed up searching in dialog show_ilog and show_olog when
             we specify a directory.
15.02.2011 - Added extract option to add an additional header in report
             indicating the report type.
17.02.2011 - In rename.rule allow the following case: nsc????.* /*/nsc????.*
             That is more then one asterix if we have only one in the
             filter part.
           - Update documentation on message structure send by AMG via
             fifo to FD.
21.02.2011 - In edit_hc pressing the button Name+size duplicate check

23.02.2011 - Added extract option to add the report type in the file
             name.
             NOTE: As of this version when extracting reports, the
                   character before the station indicator is changed
                   from an '_' to a '-'.
04.03.2011 - Detect SWIS reports correctly.
14.03.2011 - Added extract option -d to add full date to bulletin
             name in the following format TTAAii_CCCC_<year><month>YYGGgg.
             Where year is for example 2011 and month 03 for March.
           - Added extract option -f to add the full bulletin name and
             the original file name where this bulletin was extracted
             from as the first line of the bulletin/report.
15.03.2011 - For fetching files via http, added support for the HTML
             list type listing.
16.03.2011 - Even if the port for the AFD daemon afdd is not within
             the given port range, allow it to be set. Just warn the
             user that this might be a problem.
17.03.2011 - Fixed long standing bug in process fd that could lead to
             fetching jobs be started more then onced when DIR_CONFIG
             is being updated.
31.03.2011 - If directory option dupcheck is set and the queue is stopped
             for any host that is getting data from this directory the
             data is being deleted as soon as the queue is opend again.
             Fixed.
18.04.2011 - When process fd catches an unknown zombie lets still check
             the internal process list if we must remove it there too.
           - If system supports it, show user and system CPU usage of
             childs created by process AMG and FD.
27.04.2011 - In fra_view correct some output that was not shown
             correctly.
28.04.2011 - When we remember what files we retrieved locally we must
             handle the case that we do not do a full scan of the source
             directory. This bug could lead to more files being retrieved
             then necessary.
29.06.2011 - For option 'convert sohetx' do not create files of zero
             length if the file already contains a SOH and ETX.
19.07.2011 - Added a default configuration file AFD_MON.
17.08.2011 - Be more verbose when we are unable to locate a users
             home directory.
           - Fix error in extended passive mode where we do not transmit

             match current binary.
28.10.2011 - Implemented setting scheduling priorities for the different
             AFD process.
03.11.2011 - For option 'extract MRZ' and 'extract GRIB' the filename
             generated has changed, in that the XXX is replaced by a
             unique name as follows:
               <job creation time>_<unique number>_<split job counter>
             Here an example: XXX -> 4eb28696_898e_1f0
04.11.2011 - In function that handles the evaluation of the URL, handle
             case when the server= part is to long. This could lead to
             a buffer overflow.
05.11.2011 - Fix many buffer overflows and other errors or redundant
             code with the tool smatch (http://smatch.sourceforge.net/).
08.11.2011 - Properly delete everything when we issue an 'afd -i' or
             'mafd -i'.
25.11.2011 - When sending files local with scheme file and we use the
             pexec option, we must use the pexec option on the source
             file NOT the destination file!
27.11.2011 - Added scheme exec to execute some command to transmit the
             data.
28.11.2011 - During a burst it can happen that the DEFAULT_SMTP_FROM
             set in AFD_CONFIG is ignored.
01.12.2011 - It is now possible to disable the ageing of jobs with
             'No ageing jobs' in edit_hc dialog.
18.12.2011 - In afd_ctrl, dir_ctrl and mon_ctrl dialog one now just needs
             to press the left mouse button to select a line.
27.12.2011 - Increase compatability of HTTP commands.
29.12.2011 - Added support for HTTP proxy.
03.01.2012 - Accept WMO bulletin headers that have a space sign
             behind/before SOH/ETX.
04.01.2012 - For dialogs show_[deio]log, show_queue and handle_event we
             now enter the time of the current day from 00:00 (midnight)
             if we just press the enter button. Thanks to Eva-Maria Krammig!
16.01.2012 - Made size of log files SYSTEM_LOG, TRANS_DB_LOG and EVENT_LOG
             when they get rotated configurable in AFD_CONFIG.
24.01.2012 - Remove all strcpy() calls in combination with argv[] where
             we did not check the length of the input data.
           - Put in length check when using scanf() to read strings.
02.02.2012 - Added a 'Select all' button to the dialogs show_ilog,
             show_olog, show_dlog and schow_queue. Note with large
             list you might need to increase the stack size on linux
             and openmotif.
01.03.2012 - Fix bug in afdd that could lead to an endless loop.
10.03.2012 - During a burst it could happen that sf_smtp could forget
             the group list entries, thus sending the mail to the
             group list alias name and not to each member in the list.
17.03.2012 - Added %T time modifier for option assemble.
28.03.2012 - Handle cross-link error in sf_loc and save_files().
30.03.2012 - Inform when we create a directory.
01.04.2012 - Implemented multiple rename.rule files. This can be
             configured via RENAME_RULE_NAME in AFD_CONFIG.
12.04.2012 - Implemented reload parameter in afd init script.
28.04.2012 - Ignore ./ that some FTP Servers return after a NLST command.
           - Fix error where scheme ftpS was ignored.
             Thanks to Sven Knudsen from shz.de for sending patches for
             those two cases!
30.04.2012 - Always reset the total file counter and size fields when
             one of the retrieving jobs (gf_xxx) terminates.
07.05.2012 - For the option "mail header" it now possible to specify a
             rename rule identifier. Since the optional parameter to this
             option can also be full path to the mail header file it is
             important that the rename rule identifier does NOT start with
             a /.
09.05.2012 - When retrieving files we must check the length of the file
             names if they do have the correct length.
           - Process init_afd was logging some data to stdout, which
             then landed in DAEMON_LOG.init_afd and not TRANSFER_LOG
             and TRANS_DB_LOG.
12.05.2012 - Added option to check if the file send matches the local
             size after being send.
13.05.2012 - Process init_afd may not exit when it fails to stat() the
             files directory. This can be a temporary status in network
             storage or on virtual systems.
27.05.2012 - When setting the option "create target dir" it is now
             possible to specify the permissions that the target directory
             should have.
28.05.2012 - Added new option to create remote source directory.
03.06.2012 - Allow user to disable protocols via configure.

----------------------------> Version 1.4.5 <------------------------------
                             ---------------
14.06.2012 - In some cases AFD did not detect that it fails to attach to
             its internal database.
           - Function check_files() could crash due to an incorrect
             size check.
15.06.2012 - To locate an error in function calc_next_time() we extended
             the parameters so that the caller can give the information
             who is calling it.
           - Dialogs show_dlog and show_olog did not show any results
             when called from dialog dir_ctrl and a directory was selected.
20.06.2012 - When asking for HTTP options some servers return additional
             information in human readable form. This was considered in
             the code and it could happen that AFD gets out of order and
             thus lossing connection.
           - Downloading a file via HTTP could sometimes lead to a timout,
             because we tried to read an additional block beyond the end
             of the file.
04.07.2012 - Remove a buffer overflow in afdd when it evalutes directory
             information.
11.07.2012 - Automatic configuration failed when some files already
             existed and would then fail to start. Fixed.
13.07.2012 - Function copy_file() should also keep the modification and
             access time of the original file. Thanks to Sibylle Krebber.
14.07.2012 - Process dir_check could crash with certain configuration,
             because function create_db() did not calculate the correct
             amount of memory for certain structures. Thanks to David
             Bridgman for reporting and providing configuration files
             reproducing this.
26.07.2012 - fra_view now shows all values of dir_flag.
29.07.2012 - Process fd now resets the queued flag properly when it starts.
03.08.2012 - For function ssh_login() use O_NONBLOCK to get around problem
             where select() tells us there is data but when we try to
             read() there is none. The solution with an alarm() had the
             big disadvantage that it took very long and was very noisy.
06.08.2012 - Added option to timeout a transfer.
           - With the -c parameter of set_pw it was not possible to specify
             a user name that had a @ sign. Fixed.
08.08.2012 - Added initial support for IPv6.
24.08.2012 - Add date field to SMTP header as this is required by RFC 822.
06.09.2012 - Added assemble option WMO+DUMMY to assemble files with WMO
             length indicator and with a dummy length indicator at end.
17.10.2012 - With the option subject in combination with %s do not
             complain that we can only handle one %s during a burst.
           - set_pw would only set the password of the first user of
             the target host when using the -c parameter.
18.10.2012 - gf_http can now also fetch empty files. Thanks to Gary Ofield
             for reporting this!
           - When reorganising the internal queue of process fd, we
             sometimes get the position in FRA wrong. This could lead
             to several jobs trying to retrieve the same thing.
26.10.2012 - Fix an error in show_ilog dialog when it is called with the
             -d parameter and you want to print something.
27.10.2012 - When hardlink protection is enabled in Linux warn the user
             about this and then copy the file. This is a big overhead
             but it is better then losing the file.
04.11.2012 - When automatically initializing database due to some variables
             having being changed, only remove those parts that are really
             effected.
           - In afd_info dialog make active passive sign work again.
05.11.2012 - If the remote SMTP server sends a Mail Queue ID, it is now
             stored in OUTPUT_LOG and shown via info click.
10.11.2012 - Fix a bug that AFD would put files in the wrong directory
             after a burst and in the job before all files are deleted
             because of duplicate check and/or recipient.
           - In show_dlog handle case when filename does have unprintable
             characters.
11.11.2012 - For dialogs show_queue, show_olog and show_ilog handle the
             case when filename does have unprintable characters.
13.11.2012 - During a burst we must initialize the password.
19.11.2012 - In show_queue check if a retrieve job falls in the given
             time span.
           - Don't always detach from CRC file when we check for each
             individual file of a job or directory.
24.11.2012 - Added support for another CRC type which also supports the
             harware CRC on some CPU's which have SSE4.2.
           - Reorganise edit_hc dialog so that it fits on screens with
             resolutions below 1024x768.
28.11.2012 - Initializing AFD with 'afd -i' is now much less destructive.
           - Allow users to set the initialization level from 1-9 where
             9 is the same as -I, ie. most destructive.
------------------------> Released: 29.11.2012 <---------------------------



----------------------------> Version 1.4.6 <------------------------------
                             ---------------
04.12.2012 - make rpm did not work when configure was called without any
             arguments. Thanks to Andrea Nenni for reporting this.
06.12.2012 - Fix a bug in bin_file_chopper() that can lead to dir_check
             crashing.
10.12.2012 - In afd init script the status command returned 7 if service
             was not running. LSB states that this must be 3. Also the
             output of the status command is not always right. Again
             thanks to Andrea Nenni for finding this.
18.12.2012 - During TLS/SSL initialization via FTP notice when remote
             side does not allow command PBSZ.
25.12.2012 - Process init_afd now also checks for possible stuck transfer
             jobs. If it finds any, it will try to terminate this
             process.
21.01.2013 - Fix compile error under Fedora 18. Thanks to Jose Mauro de
             Rezende for reporting this error.

30.01.2013 - If we cannot change back to the home directory in sf_ftp,
             do not show an error. Just inform the user and reconnect.
01.02.2013 - Added support to make timeout in dupcheck fixed, ie. not
             being cumulative.
05.02.2013 - Since the dialog edit_hc modifies the FSA when the alias
             order changes, we need to set the correct umask so it gets
             the correct permissions.
07.02.2013 - Added %e configuration parameter to allow one to execute
             a command to determine part or the full directory name.
             Thanks to Bill Welch for this idea.
11.02.2013 - Don't set a default SSH port. If none is specified take the
             default of the SSH client.
15.02.2013 - The assemble option WMO+DUMMY was wrongly evaluated as an
             extract option.
           - Added extract option WMO+CHK which checks if the end really
             contains an ETX and if not searches for it towards the end.
26.02.2013 - Fix error when afd_ctrl dialog could not save setup
             configuration into the local users directory when sticky
             bit has been set and AFD does not have permission to
             look into the users directory.
28.02.2013 - The transfer timeout had not been considered for the
             system call connect(). This has now been fixed.
01.03.2013 - In function exec_cmd() be more verbose when the maximum
             read buffer has been reached.
07.03.2013 - Added function sftp_chmod() to change mode with protocol
             SFTP. Unfortunatly, the protocol is not so clever that
             it can be done via attributes structure, at least with
             openssh this does not work. Sad!
09.03.2013 - When retrieving files from a remote host and we split
             up the downloads between sveral process we sometimes
             would not count the number of files correctly.
10.03.2013 - Handle case where system does not have the directory
             /var/lock/subsys.
16.03.2013 - Process dir_check did always cut of the last character
             of the file name when it logs a deleted file because there

17.03.2013 - Dialog show_dlog did not show the correct Proc/User when
             showing more information about a job.
21.04.2013 - Handle case when user renames host alias in message
             (untested!).
           - When keep connected for gf_xxx is set always show in
             intervals what we did in TRANSFER_LOG.
25.04.2013 - Added aditional optional value -1 for 'delete unknown files'
             directory option. Meaning to delete unknown file immediately.
27.04.2013 - Added FTP FEAT command.
28.04.2013 - Added support for FTP MLST type directory listing (RFC 3659).
07.05.2013 - If a time job is changed by the user and AFD cannot find
             a similar new one, it now warns the user that they are being
             deleted.
20.05.2013 - Simplified code of function check_files() by deleting lots
             of duplicate code.

             the case when it does not read the complete line.
05.07.2013 - Process fd could crash when lots of retrieving jobs return
             at once. Fixed.
10.07.2013 - All option menus now show the correct font.
14.07.2013 - Store information about allowing keep connected for sending
             and/or fetching in HOST_CONFIG.
24.07.2013 - HTTP PUT now works. It broke by adding the HTTP OPTIONS
             command.

             afd_ctrl, dir_ctrl and mafd_ctrl dialogs.
           - Added more warnings when directory options are not correct.

             and the name was not DIR_CONFIG, AFD would refuse to start.
             Fixed.
06.08.2013 - Added option to add a sequence number when converting files
             via the convert option.

25.08.2013 - In afd_ctrl dialog added option to have compact process
             status.
29.08.2013 - In show_ilog, show_olog and show_dlog dialog we now unmap
             from the internal database as soon as possible to narrow
             the window where it can crash due to a job being removed.
30.08.2013 - Fix error in HTTP code where we sometimes did not read the
             last chunk when remote side uses chunked encoding.
07.09.2013 - Store some important data in system independant format.
             ASCII text files.
12.09.2013 - Changing the VIEW_DATA_PROG in AFD_CONFIG could lead to
             a SIGSEGV when viewing files via show_olog and/or show_queue
             dialog. Thanks to Alexander Maul for finding this.
15.09.2013 - When changing values in header files (MAX_NO_PARALLEL_JOBS,

             values that are lost due to database changes.
17.09.2013 - During HTTP retrieve if we fail to find the directory, do
             not remove all information we stored about the files retrieved
             so far.
           - If the directory where we retrieve data from a remote system
             has time information in the diretory name (%t) and keep
             connected is set for this host it could happen that AFD never
             changes the directory due to time change. Fixed.
23.09.2013 - When doing trans_rename with FTP, rename the file in the
             final directory.

01.10.2013 - When alda ist started in continous mode (-c or -C) it did
             not notice when a log got rotated. Fixed.
           - For alda added parameter -R to be able to specify how many
             log files should be kept.
03.10.2013 - Initial systemd unit file for AFD.
18.10.2013 - Beautified output of fsa_view, so it shows the table aligned
             properly.

             number of errors that may occur befor the directory
             becomes red.
           - Fix error in gf_xxx where it ignores the 'Allow burst'
             flag, thus endlessly fetching files from one directory.
           - Added directory option 'do not parallelize'. To speed up
             the process of fetching files from a remote host and there
             are many files in one directory, it creates more processes
             to fetch from this directory. This can have the disadvantage
             that it can take quite long before it fetches files from
             another directory on the same host. When this option is
             added it will just use one process per directory for fetching
             files.
16.12.2013 - In rename.rule when not specifying which * or ? we want to
             adress can be the cause of a crash of the program using
             function change_name().
23.12.2013 - To make errors more visible in dir_ctrl dialog, make the
             error counter (ec) red if it is greater then 0.
31.12.2013 - Fix an error on isdup() that made the timeout value terminate
             a few minutes to early.
11.01.2014 - Implemented dupcheck for trans_rename option.
