   ======================================================================

   1. General Information



   1.1 What is AFD?

   The Automatic File Distributor provides a framework for very flexible,
   non-stop, log and debug-able delivery of an arbitrary amount of files to
   multiple recipients as expressed in URLs (currently mailing and ftp
   supported with the mailto://user@domain and ftp://user:password@host URL
   conventions). AFD stands for Automatic File Distributor.


   1.2 Where can I get AFD?

   You can get information from the following locations:
      http://www.dwd.de/AFD                - Homepage
      ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/afd             - directory containing the stable
                                             releasese of AFD
      ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/afd/development - directory with unstable
                                             releases of AFD
      ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/afd/bin         - here you will find precompiled
                                             binaries


   1.3 Will AFD run with Windows XXX?

   No. Currently there is some work to get AFD running under Cygwin.


   1.4 What is the history of AFD?

   In 1995 the German Weater Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)) was
   doing its international file exchange via scripts. It was soon realized
   that this did cause a very high cpu load and was not very flexible.
   For this reason it was decided to develop a file distribution system
   that was to be very portable and easy to handle by a single person.
   Here follow some important millestones of the AFD:

      - 04.02.1996 First release and first operational use at DWD
                   (only for distributing files to international partners).
      - 22.06.1998 Release of version 1.0.0 with a complete rewrite
                   of the process FD to handle the internal
                   communication between FD and AMG via FIFO's.
      - 08.08.1999 Released 1.1.0. Included time job and process to
                   monitor other AFD's.
      - 03.02.2000 AFD released under the GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GNU).
      - 24.09.2000 Released 1.2.0. AFD is now able to retrieve files
                   via FTP from a remote host.


   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   2. Compiling

   2.1 How do I compile AFD under XXX?

   Run ./configure to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
   ./configure --help gives a list of possible options with slightly
   longer descriptions in README.configure. See also 2.2 Security
   considerations.

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
   the `configure' script does not know about. You can give `configure'
   initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.

   You can do that on the command line like this:

      ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

   Before compiling you might want set some other preferences in
   src/afdsetup.h and/or src/init_afd/afddefs.h. But note, changing some
   values here might make this incompatible with a previous AFD version
   and AFD will no longer work when it is started. So best to leave these
   values as they are. If you do change them it's best to run the following
   command before starting AFD again:

            afd -i

   This will initialize the internal database of AFD. After this it will
   be possible to run AFD with the new values. 


   2.2 Security considerations

   Before compiling AFD you need to decide where you want to install
   AFD and if you want other users to have access to your AFD. There
   are currently three possibilities:

      2.2.1 Single user

      This is the default and you need to set no addititional flags
      with configure. Here only the user that has started the AFD
      may have access and may control it.


      2.2.2 Group access

      Via this method all users of the same group have access and may
      control the AFD. This access can be further restricted in the
      $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/afd.users file. To use this you need to start
      configure with the option --enable-group_can_write.

      2.2.3 Any users

      To allow any user to have access you must set the flag
      --enable-setuid_progs in configure. This will set the setuid flag
      for some binaries. The access can be further restricted in the
      $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/afd.users file. It is not recommendet to set
      this if you install the binaries as root.
      
   2.3 I get the following error when compiling:

      2.3.1 Can't open include file 'X11/Xaw/StripChart.h'

      HPUX for example does not include the Xaw libraries and headers.
      You can either install these on your system or in
      src/UI/Motif/Makefile.am comment out all occurance of afd_load. Then
      AFD will compile without the dialog afd_load, which is not required
      for running AFD.


      2.3.2 Can't find library for -lXpm (only versions < 1.2.2)

      Most commercial unix vendors do not include the Xpm libraries.
      so either install these on your system or comment out the line:

            #define _WITH_XPM

      You can savely do this and you will hardly know any difference.


      2.3.3 /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXm (only versions < 1.3.0)

      Either you do not have the Motif library or you need to supply
      the correct path to it in Include.mk with the variable XLIBPATH.
      On a Linux system this is for example set as follows:

            XLIBPATH = -L/usr/X11R6/lib

      If you do not have Motif install either OpenMotif or LessTiff.


   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   3. Installing

   3.1 How do I install AFD?

      3.1.1 Installing from source

      In the source directory just issue the command 'make install' to
      install the binaries in the ../bin and ../sbin directories.

      3.1.2 RPM

      This is the easies method, just issue the following command:

           rpm -Uvh <RPM filename>

      To create an RPM, the simples way is to issue the following
      commands as root:

           rpm -Uvh <SRPM filename>
           cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS     # This is distribution dependent
           rpmbuild -ba afd.spec


   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   4. Configuration

   4.1 When starting AFD or one of its process I get the following error:

      4.1.1 ERROR   : Failed to determine AFD working directory!

      Either the environment variable AFD_WORK_DIR is not set or you did
      not supply the working directory of the AFD with the '-w' option.
      Without it AFD will not run.

      4.1.2 You are not permitted to use this program. [<username>]

      The user <username> is not permitted to start the program. If you
      want to give the user the permission to start this program add
      the users name to $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/afd.users and the programs he
      may use.

      4.1.3 ERROR   : Cannot read DIR_CONFIG file : No such file or
                      directory

      There is no DIR_CONFIG file in the $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc directory.
      To run AFD you must have a valid DIR_CONFIG file!


   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   5. General usage

   5.1 DIR_CONFIG/HOST_CONFIG

      5.1.1 How do I activate the changes in the DIR_CONFIG or
            HOST_CONFIG file?

      You need to press 'Reread DIR_CONFIG' or 'Reread HOST_CONFIG' in
      the afd_ctrl dialog under 'Control'. Or if you do not want to use
      the graphical interface use udc to update the DIR_CONFIG or uhc
      to update the HOST_CONFIG from the sbin directory.

      5.1.2 The password has changed but it is still seems to use
            the old one. What's wrong?

      The message that is causing this error still has the old password.
      You must manually change this yourself (this will hopefully be
      fixed in Version 2.x.x). To get the message number look into the
      TRANSFER_LOG, you will see the number right after the '#' sign
      at the end of the error message. Now edit ths message with this
      number in the message directory and then press the 'Retry'
      button.

      5.1.3 Do I always have to press the 'Reread HOST_CONFIG' and
            'Reread DIR_CONFIG' button?

      No, if you have made changes to both the DIR_CONFIG and HOST_CONFIG
      file you just need to press the 'Reread DIR_CONFIG' button (or call
      udc from the sbin directory).

      5.1.4 I have lost some or all the content of the DIR_CONFIG,
            what can I do?

      There is a tool get_dc_data which when called without arguments
      will print the whole DIR_CONFIG, as stored within AFD, to standard
      out.

   5.2 Operational questions

      5.2.1 The network connection to ALL hosts is down. What should
            be done?

      No action is necessary. AFD will stop the queue those hosts where
      a lot of jobs queue up and it will start them again as soon as the
      network comes back. If unsure you can stop AMG so no more jobs will
      be generated for FD. FD will still continue to try and distribute
      files at regular intervalls.

      5.2.2 The connection to one host is down and the job queue counter
            is constantly increasing. What action is necessary?

      Actually no action is necessary. Since the AFD will itself stop
      the queue for this host if it reaches any critical value (and it
      will automatically reactivate the queue when everything is okay
      again). But it also does not hurt when you stop the queue for
      this host. But don't forget to turn it on again!

      5.2.3 When a connection to one host is down should I stop transfer
            or stop the queue?

      It depends on how long the connection to host is down and on the
      number of files that are to be generated. Stop the transfer if you
      wish to interrupt the current transfers and/or you know this is
      only a short interrupt. But be careful that not to many jobs queue
      up (AFD will automatically stop the queue if this is the case and
      start it again). Best thing is to just stop the queue. Or leave it
      to AFD, it will automatically stop the queue and start it again.

      5.2.4 An error has occurred for connection XYZ. How do you know
            what type of error has occurred?

      Look in the Transfer Log file and see what type of error it is. If
      it says "Failed to connect." then it is a network error or the
      remote host is down. Check the network to the remote host. With
      other errors it is best to turn on the debug mode for this host
      and evaluate the output in the Transfer Debug Log. (see also 6.1)

      5.2.5 The problem to a host has been solved, but it always takes
            such a long time before it tries to send the files again.
            How can one test immediately whether the problem is solved
            or not?

      Press the retry button.

      5.2.6 There is no response or action at all. Even starting or
            stopping the AMG or FD does nothing. What's wrong?

      Most properly the AFD was not shutdown correctly. Log out of the
      afd_ctrl and log in again. Be patience this can take a while
      (up to 30s) because every time you call the program afd it will
      check whether there is an AFD already running. If not it will
      restart the AFD. All other programs and shared memory areas
      will be removed.

      5.2.7 There are files in the directory, but AFD does not send
            them.

      There could be many reasons why the files are not being send:

         - Make sure that there is a rule in the DIR_CONFIG to
           transmit those files.
         - The files in the source directory must have the correct
           permission, ie. AFD must have read permission for those
           files.
         - Ensure that the input queue or transfer is NOT stopped
           in the afd_ctrl dialog. The two leds next to the hostname
           and debug led must be green.

   6. Error Messages

   6.1 FTP Error Messages

      6.1.1 Disc quota exceeded.

      The user may not write any more data into this directory since since
      the quota is exceeded.

      6.1.2 Disc full.

      The disk on the remote host is full.

      6.1.3 The process cannot access the file because it is being used by
            another process.

      Another process on the remote machine has the file we wish to send
      open and the operating system does not allow the ftp daemon to open
      the same file again.

      6.1.4 Failed to send password for user XXXXX.

      The password for user XXXXX is wrong. To correct this correct the
      password in the DIR_CONFIG and read 5.1.2.

      6.1.5 Failed to send password for user XXXXX due to timeout.

      If this error message appears frequently then its very likely that
      the remote machine is overloaded and not able to handle your
      request. This is a common error on computers with NT.
      If this message appears only once then the network connection is
      broken.

      6.1.6 Failed to send password for user XXXXX.
            530-User XXXXX: can't change directory to YYYY

      The directory YYYY for user XXXXX on the remote host, does not
      exist or does not have the correct permissions.

      6.1.7 Failed to connect() to XXXXX : Connection timed out.

      The remote host is not reachable. Either the network to this host
      is not functioning properly or the host is down. This seems to be
      a very common error.

      6.1.8 Failed to connect() to XXXXX : Connection refused.

      Here we do reach the remote host via the network but there is no
      FTP daemon running or listining at the expected port.

      6.1.9 421-Service not available, closing control connection.

      This error message can appear after we connected to the remote
      host. It means that it is currently being shuttown and not able
      to handle any further requests.

      6.1.10 Remote hang up.

      If you only receive this error it means that the remote host
      refuses any connections to this port. It could be an indication
      that the remote host is overloaded or is in big trouble.

      If this error appears in conjunction with another error message,
      for example: Failed to change directory to YYYY. Then the remote
      host has just cut the connection, either because it is being
      shuttdown or has a very high load.
