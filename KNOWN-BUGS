Bug   : When switching automatically back to the original host
        this is sometimes done twice.
Reason: Unknown

Bug   : The file counter (fc) an and the file size (fs) are not set
        correctly during a burst.
Reason: Unknown

Bug   : During a burst FD sometimes does not find any files to send
        but when it tries to remove the job directory there are suddenly
        files in it.
Reason: Hope 1.1.x will solve this. AMG sometimes does link files to a
        new job directory, allthough they should be copied.
