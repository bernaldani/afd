             * until it is done. At first glance it looks as
             * if the first is the correct solution. It has

             * changes the alias name of the host, the data is
             * lost. For this reason the second option was
             * implemented. This has the disadvantage that since
             * we cannot differentiate here if we realy deleted a
             * host or just renamed it we must continue sending
             * data to this host, even if the host has been
             * deleted by the user. We do this by putting this
             * host at the end of the FSA that is not visible to
             * the user. We hide it from the user.
