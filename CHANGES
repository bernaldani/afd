                             Version 1.0.x
                             =============

---------------------------> Version 1.0.1 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
23.06.1998 - After a restart the number of files are not shown
             correctly when a burst was active before the restart.
           - Minor spelling corrections.
24.06.1998 - AFD_LOAD KBytes sometimes shows ridiculous negative
             values.  Build in check for values less then 0.01.
           - Added option "secure ftp". This logs in with user
             anonymous and password user@hostname before it does the
             real login.
           - show_stat prints out a total even if all values are zero.
25.06.1998 - Sometimes the INST_JOB is started without a valid shared
             memory ID. If this happens AMG terminates to be restarted
             by INIT_AFD.
26.06.1998 - bin_file_chopper() loses data when fill Bytes are being
             used. Fixed.
27.06.1998 - rm_job can handle job names with directory information.
29.06.1998 - log_append() appended the hole message! Fixed.
30.06.1998 - When messages cache is updated (ie. some messages removed),
             the position indicator in the message queue was not
             updated! Fixed.
------------------------> Released: 30.06.1998 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.0.2 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
05.07.1998 - When stopping FD it kills all sf_xxx process with the SIGKILL
             signal.
09.07.1998 - If a host is disabled all current jobs will be deleted.
13.07.1998 - When messages in the message directory are deleted by hand,
             FD did not remove this job from its cache or the job ID list,
	     when it is no longer used (ie. it would remain there forever!).
	   - If a host is removed from the FSA, jobs in the queue of the
	     FD would remain there.
25.07.1998 - Position of directory name in structure job_id_data was not
             updated when a directory is removed.
           - Included number of active transfers in afd_load window.
27.07.1998 - When messages are deleted from the system, a compactor
             output is written to the system log.
           - When a host is removed and there are messages queued in the
             FD, these messages would remain forever. Fixed.
28.07.1998 - Changed mode of HOST_CONFIG file from 600 to 660, so when
             two users use the same subset of binaries both can edit
             the HOST_CONFIG file.
30.07.1998 - All log files had the permission 666!!!! Changed to 644.
02.08.1998 - Optimized removing jobs from the JID structure. AFD´s with
             large DIR_CONFIG files took about 20-30 seconds to clean
             up there internal database. Lets hope this speeds up
             thinks a bit.
03.08.1998 - Removed minor bug in bin_file_chopper().
06.08.1998 - Comparison in function lookup_job_id() failed to detect
             any difference in jobs with same recipient and options but
             different file filters. Fixed.
09.08.1998 - New function to recreate messages when they are corrupt or
             have been deleted.
           - Added rotating dash to View Transfer dialog.
14.08.1998 - Appending files did not work. Fixed.
           - When using edit_hc dialog to turn off host switching,
             some parameters where not reset correctly.
17.08.1998 - show_ilog would crash with a seg-fault when some data is not
             available. Fixed.
------------------------> Released: 17.08.1998 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.0.3 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
20.08.1998 - Due to some dump unnecessary optimization bin_file_chopper()
             would miss some data under certain conditions. Fixed.
21.08.1998 - Included sequence numbering to sf_wmo.
22.08.1998 - Defined _FLUSH_FTP_WRITE as default.
           - Setting last transfer time even when failing to send a file
             in FD. Otherwise when no file has been send successfully
             and the database is changed for this job all files will
             be removed since FD will remove the message for this JID.
           - Added new command SSTAT for AFDD to show summary status of
             AFD.
23.08.1998 - Added JID number to error message when FD failed to
             distribute a file.
24.08.1998 - Removed optimization from bin_file_chopper(). Was causing
             to much trouble :-(((
25.08.1998 - New program to notify AMG to reread DIR_CONFIG or
             HOST_CONFIG.
26.08.1998 - show_ilog dialog did not show all information. Will now
             show all information of current jobs only.
27.08.1998 - When ALL files are being removed due to age by the FD and
             the queue is automatically stopped, FD would only retry
             after a file_dir_check is done. Setting error counter to
             zero when there are no more files.
01.09.1998 - Reduced process time of afd_ctrl to 1/10th of the usual
             time.
02.09.1998 - The message cache of FD was not flushed correctly, causing
             messages to be flushed that where not to be flushed. Under
             certain conditions it could cause the FD to crash due to
             trying to flush memory areas that do not belong to the
             cache. Before the messages get flushed they now get sorted
             and are being checked to ensure the correct ones get
             flushed.
03.09.1998 - When sending mails the mail server can be specified for
             each recipient separately, with the ;server=<host name>
             option.
           - In afd_ctrl dialog the sizes are shown with a decimal point.
05.09.1998 - It is now possible to configure the AFD over the AFD_CONFIG
             file. The values in this file are always read when the AFD
             is started, if the file does not exist the default values
             in config.h will take effect.
06.09.1998 - Default to just one connect() try in ftp_connect() and
             smtp_connect().
07.09.1998 - Gotcha array in create_db() was NOT initialized, causing
             some unnecessary and dangerous deletion of jobs. Fixed.
08.09.1998 - Put in check to disallow bursting when current FSA has the
             status STALE.
           - Handle case correctly when a remote FTP server replies
             230, ie. no password is required to log in.
09.09.1998 - Added new tool to do all commands from the host menu from
             the afd_ctrl dialog (Start/stop queue, Start/stop transfer,
             Enable/disable host, Switch host, Retry and Debug).
------------------------> Released: 14.09.1998 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.0.4 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
17.09.1998 - In update_db() when checking for program name, we just check
             everything after the /, so it works correctly when calling
             the program with a path.
           - check_files() no longer reports that the file has vanished
             (ENOENT).
18.09.1998 - When ftpcmd() receives an EPIPE sf_ftp() does not send a
             QUIT to the remote site.
20.09.1998 - SSTAT command of afdd now shows the entry counter of the
             system log.
           - When more then one file is used with option restart, sf_ftp
             would go into an endless loop.
21.09.1998 - If renaming was not successful and the restart option is set
             sf_ftp would append the file to the end of the already
             transmitted file.
           - If files are being removed due to age or are from disabling
             a host, it could happen that one of the file was marked
             for appending. For this reason sf_ftp now always checks
             if the append list is still up to date.
25.09.1998 - Definitely remove any messages in the queue even when it
             currently is transmitting data. Otherwise if a host has
             been removed it tries to locate a host in the FSA that is
             no longer available.
03.10.1998 - When FD is started the first time, it waits for the
             inst_job to finish writing the JID structure.
           - exec_cmd() tries to read any replies from the program
             it started, to avoid any possible deadlocks.
14.10.1998 - Fixed memory leak in get_file_names() of sf_xxx.
------------------------> Released: 15.10.1998 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.0.5 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
16.10.1998 - Closing stdout, stderr and stdin in daemon_init(). Otherwise
             starting AFD via the rsh command would hang.
18.10.1998 - New program to show status of remote AFD's.
10.11.1998 - New option "check reply" to wait for a reply from the remote
             side when something was send via WMO sockets.
11.11.1998 - Make sequence numbering for WMO sockets optional and do NOT
             set this as default.
           - Fixed bug in get_rename_rules() that causes inst_job to
             crash when there is a blank behind any rule.
           - Allow to comment out a rule.
           - Added AFD name (from file afd.name) to setup file of the
             afd_ctrl dialog. So different setups can be stored regardless
             of the user and remote display.
12.11.1998 - Display host toggle information in transfer and transfer
             debug log.
           - Solved some minor problems with automatic host switching.
13.11.1998 - If for whatever reason FD thinks one of its process is not
             its own child, it is now taken from the queue and restarted.
           - When the FD claims there is no free display position it
             checks if all process that claim a slot are still alive.
           - Reorganize output of afd_mon process so it shows the number
             of files and their size still to be send.
           - Eventually found cause of the two outputs of "Stopped afd_mon".
           - Some stupid dump systems like NT sometimes do not return
             any data to the LIST command. Handle this case so DEBUG
             can be enabled for this host.
------------------------> Released: 16.11.1998 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.0.6 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
17.11.1998 - Handle case when sf_xxx cannot determine the JID number.
18.11.1998 - In wmocmd() setup socket with the O_NONBLOCK flag.
           - When FD exits, it will wait for all its children to return.
           - In AFDD do not count errors when host is an error host.
21.11.1998 - The length of the filename shown in the View Transfer dialog
             is now configurable in the afd_ctrl.setup file.
24.11.1998 - Printing selected items in show_xlog would file if last
             item was selected. Fixed.
25.11.1998 - Did not check return value of function qb_pos_pid() in FD
             causing it to crash under rare circumstances.
27.11.1998 - New option "attach file" to encode a file in base64 and
             then attach it to a mail (MIME Version 1.0).
           - New option "mail header" to put some common mail context
             into the mail.
01.12.1998 - AFD does not start when the log directory does not exist.
             Fixed.
02.12.1998 - When pressing the retry button the FD sometimes did NOT
             select the next message with the highest priority. Fixed.
           - FD will not reset the error counter when files are deleted
             due to age.
09.12.1998 - Remove O_NONBLOCK flag from wmocmd(). read() in
             wmo_check_reply() was trying to read to many characters
             from the socket. This was the reason for read() hanging
             indefinitely. Fixed.
10.12.1998 - Printer command and default printer can now be configured
             in the file AFD_CONFIG.
           - Printing to a file where we do not have permissions would
             terminate show_xlog silently. Fixed.
------------------------> Released: 11.12.1998 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.0.7 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
16.12.1998 - Added extra check in check_burst() to see if unique
             directory name is in FSA.
18.12.1998 - Bug in filter()!!! Would not find the following case:
             TRI*DM -> TRIDM398121700033CLDM; problem is the first
             DM. Fixed.
10.01.1999 - Inform user how many directories are not in the same
             file system as that of the AFD.
15.01.1999 - Found bug that sometimes caused the show_xlog dialog to
             show the wrong source directory. The same bug caused
             inst_job to crash on start under certain conditions.
16.01.1999 - Added scrollbars to the show_info dialog.
           - Reorganized all X program's to have one common header
             (x_common_defs.h).
17.01.1999 - Process afdd reports back any important changes to
             afd_mon.
           - When AFD is shutdown, afdd now reports this to afd_mon.
21.01.1999 - Option "file name is header" does now work for sf_ftp
             as well.
------------------------> Released: 21.01.1999 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.0.8 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
24.01.1999 - make_xprocess() now checks if the command returns anything
             on stdout or stderr and displays it in a warn dialog.
           - Finished afd_mon and mon_ctrl programs.
01.02.1999 - Change sign to debug in afdd when connection is reset by
             peer.
04.02.1999 - Oops! Bug in makefile for FD. Forgot to change mode for
             sf_wmo.
05.02.1999 - Big bug in eval_dir_config()! Forgot to allocate memory
             for the number of destination, but due to the fact that
             this memory is shared memory and shared memory is allocated
             in blocks and the memory exceeded was only 2-3 Bytes, this
             error never showed (after three operational years and
             millions of different DIR_CONFIGS!!!!) up until today.
13.02.1999 - Multiple recipients for show_olog.
15.02.1999 - Multiple recipients for show_ilog.

                            ---------------
18.02.1999 - The value "Filesize in use done" was not correct in fsa_view.
           - Function check_burst() did not check the job ID when counting
             the jobs that are already bursting. Thus a burst would fail
             because it was trying to burst files that are not of the
             same ID.
21.02.1999 - show_stat showed two lines with total values. Fixed.
           - Added mon_info dialog for mon_ctrl.
           - Did not initialize a variable correctly for multiple
             recipients for show_xlog (13-17.02.1999). Fixed.
24.02.1999 - Burst counter in transfer log was wrong for sf_ftp and
             sf_wmo.
25.02.1999 - Added option eumetsat to add EUMETSAT headers to files
             being send via FTP.
26.02.1999 - The AFD monitor only shows file rate, connect rate is
             dropped.
28.02.1999 - Dialog to view data from the DIR_CONFIG for a specific
             host.
------------------------> Released: 01.03.1999 <---------------------------



                             Version 1.1.x
                             =============

---------------------------> Version 1.1.0 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
04.03.1999 - Calculating the offset for initializing a newly reallocated
             piece of memory was done wrong when the number of hosts
             is getting larger then HOST_BUF_SIZE. Fixed.
           - Two new parameters for the AFD_CONFIG_FILE: MAX_COPIED_FILES
             and MAX_COPIED_FILE_SIZE.
           - Introduce a size limit (MAX_COPIED_FILE_SIZE) of the files
             copied before giving the job to FD.
10.03.1999 - If domain name is given it was always stored without it
             in real_hostname. Fixed.
12.03.1999 - send_message() sends messages more then once when the
             inst_job() forked/split the job. Fixed.
19.03.1999 - init_sf() opened sys_log_fifo twice!
           - Failed to set FD_CLOEXE flag after open() system call,
             that left many unnecessary open file descriptors after
             forking and calling one of the exec functions.
           - FD checks if there are jobs in the queue with a higher
             priority then the current job that is being checked
             for burst. If there are no other jobs with a higher
             priority check_burst() will ignore the burst limit.
20.03.1999 - Removed unique number from archive name and introduced
             ARCHIVE_STEP_TIME to reduce the number of archive
             directories. Lets hope this will minimize the problem
             that IRIX has when there are lots of directories.
25.03.1999 - Automatic host switching did not work correctly. Fixed.
27.03.1999 - Don't send files of zero length with sf_wmo.
01.04.1999 - Directories with paused hosts are now checked at certain
             intervals.
           - Added more aggressive checking for bursting.

08.04.1999 - Made ONE_DIR_COPY_TIMEOUT as default and configurable in
             AFD_CONFIG file.
12.04.1999 - Certain dialogs of mon_ctrl and afd_ctrl can only be
             started once.
13.04.1999 - If the statistic file is of length zero the afd_stat
             program does not start. Fixed.
           - sf_loc wrote to system_log when it failed to copy files
             to the target directory. Fixed.
26.04.1999 - Added option "no login" for sf_ftp.
11.05.1999 - Nasty bug in process mon that made it go in an infinite
             loop grabbing more and more memory, when stopping the
             process and it currently had no connection to the remote
             AFD it was suppose to monitor. Fixed.
13.05.1999 - Doing a 'Reread DIR_CONFIG' and there was only a change
             in the HOST_CONFIG, could under certain conditions result
             in all hosts being marked as not in DIR_CONFIG. Fixed.
15.05.1999 - Finished basics of time job for AMG.
22.05.1999 - Got daemon logs working.
05.06.1999 - AMG gets the hostname wrong when at end of recipient string
             there is a ; and there is no dot in the hostname and no
             no directory was set. Fixed.
           - New directory option EC=<integer char value> to tell AMG to
             wait until the files end character is the integer value.
06.06.1999 - afd_mon collects all host alias names and real host names
             that are being served by the AFD's being monitored.
12.06.1999 - Option to change owner of copied/moved file.
29.06.1999 - Forgot to close a file descriptor in create_fsa() and
             afd_stat!
12.07.1999 - Mask file names when they contain a ";" or a space,
             otherwise they are evaluated by the shell.
16.07.1999 - Log all connections to AFDD.
18.07.1999 - Allow only certain hosts to connect to AFDD.
21.08.1999 - Added new log type CONFIG (dark green).
           - show_dlog() was checking wrong permissions.
22.08.1999 - Use type-of-service field to minimize delay for control
             connection and maximize throughput for data connection for
             FTP.
           - Transfer- and Transfer-debug log dialog can show individual
             jobs.

---------------------------> Version 1.1.1 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
10.09.1999 - When checking for last character in a file and the character
             does not match, that file would only be checked again when
             another file would arrive.
           - When stopping AMG or FD open another dialog to ask user
             if he really wants to do so.
12.09.1999 - Added new option subject, to specify the subject for mails.
20.09.1999 - show_log showed host names that where one or more characters
             longer then the one it should show. Fixed.
21.09.1999 - It's now possible to specify ~username as the first part of
             the directory (username can also be omitted).
22.09.1999 - Function filter() under rare condition changed the filter
             itself!! Thanks to Herbert Lepper for finding this one.
04.10.1999 - format_info() of show_ilog would SEGV when file names get
             very long. Fixed.
           - With scheme 'file' its no longer necessary to specify the
             full path.
07.10.1999 - Additional memory checks in delete_log and output_log.
           - New option "force copy" for scheme file to force files to
             be copied and not linked nor memory mapped (good for copying
             to /dev/null).
09.10.1999 - Implemented DIR_CHECK_TIMEOUT, so when there are many
             directories and/or the disks are very slow the administrator
             has the possibility to mark some directories as important.
24.10.1999 - sf_ftp could corrupt the fc and fs fields of afd_ctrl
             when files that are detected to be duplicate and thus not
             send and at the same time it is bursting. Fixed.
31.10.1999 - Fixed some bugs in append functions.
------------------------> Released: 03.11.1999 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.1.2 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
26.11.1999 - If file is deleted due to age but is marked for appending
             in the message. This mark will always be left in the
             message. Even more dangerous if now another file comes
             with the same name it will append it to the old file on
             the remote site!
           - When renaming files and the new name is the same as the
             old name, the counters in the afd_ctrl dialog will be
             incorrect. Even worth, when there is only one file in
             the job, this would be lost! Fixed.
04.12.1999 - Needed to change version.h so it works correctly when
             debugging.

           - The chown option accepts a "." as well as ":" when
             specifying both user and group.
           - Its now possible to send RETRY to archive_watch so
             it rescans the directories.
25.12.1999 - Limit the number of process that dir_check may generate
             on a per directory basis.

                            ---------------
27.01.2000 - Fixed deadlock in dir_check, when collecting files from
             the queue.
29.01.2000 - Fixed some bugs in _LIMIT_PROCESS_PER_DIR.
           - ftp_close_data() waits for an answer when we received
             a timeout. Fixed.
01.02.2000 - Dialog edit_hc failed to reset 'File size offset' parameter.
------------------------> Released: 02.02.2000 <---------------------------

                            ---------------
24.02.2000 - Specifying only the "mail header <some file>" option caused
             sf_smtp to SEGV. Fixed.
02.03.2000 - Killing job details window via window manager and then
             restart it caused afd_ctrl to crash. Fixed.
           - Double the timeout when closing the FTP data connection.
03.03.2000 - Switching back automatically does not work correctly when
             the secondary host is gone. Fixed.
05.03.2000 - When appending files where no data is send, ie the
             whole file is send but we get a timeout closing the data
             connection, we use the structure stat stat_buf uninitialized!
             This can cause havoc in afd_stat!
           - The ftp_list() function failed to close its data connection!
------------------------> Released: 08.03.2000 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.1.6 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
11.03.2000 - Switching back automatically did still not work correctly!
             Hopefully this is fixed now.
03.04.2000 - dir_check terminates normally when it no longer can access
             one of the directories that have to be monitored. Fixed.
04.04.2000 - Specifying "priority1" would result in AMG ignoring this
             entry without any comment. Fixed by accepting this.
           - Automatic host switching under heavy load did sometimes
             not work. Fixed.

08.05.2000 - If the number of messages queued is very large and most
             messages belong to a host that has a very slow network
             connection, FD becomes very slow.
09.05.2000 - Reading from AFD_CONFIG file the value for MAX_CONNECTIONS
             always failed silently. Fixed.
12.05.2000 - AMG does not evaluate the DIR_CONFIG when the first line
             starts with the [directory] identifier. Thanks to
             Tasos Tsiolakidis for finding this bug.
13.05.2000 - Speedup initialization of AFD when it is started the first
             time.

             is an active AFD.
23.01.2000 - New option -no_input for afd_ctrl and mon_ctrl.

             saver!
29.01.2000 - Added new function ftp_size().
           - When dir_check checks for paused hosts, these are now being
             rescanned more efficient and saver.
30.01.2000 - Stopping transfer of a host will terminate the connections.
01.02.2000 - Process init_afd releases any queue locks. This should fix

             and files are still being queued.
03.02.2000 - Fixed bug in filter() where it would solve the following

             the FSA, DIR_CONFIG and HOST_CONFIG.
18.07.2000 - Added two new options -c <config file> and -f <file name file>
             to aftp.

             sf_xxx process where killed. Fixed.
           - Doing buffered read() in sf_smtp as well.

05.09.2000 - In the mon_ctrl dialog the process LED's would not blink
             when a process terminated abnormally. Fixed.
08.09.2000 - New AMG option "time no collect". This option is similar
             to the "time" option, only that it does NOT collect data
             outside the specified times.
09.09.2000 - archive_watch is now able to read data from the command
             fifo.
           - System log radar did not continue when a duplicate
             message appeared after more then 10 seconds. Fixed.

             now shown with a greater sign.
24.09.2000 - Using rmdir() instead of unlink() in rec_rmdir() as suggested
             in man page of solaris.
------------------------> Released: 24.09.2000 <---------------------------

                            ---------------
29.09.2000 - In mon_ctrl and afd_ctrl, doing a Alt+Mouse button 1 caused
             it to SEGV. Fixed.

             place, is now removed.
           - The hostname displayed by AFD, would not change when no
             afd_ctrl dialog is open and automatic host switching is active
             for this host! Fixed.
16.10.2000 - show_ilog crashes with SIGBUS when there is garbage in the
             logfile. Fixed.
20.10.2000 - When remote port hangs up, still trying to read from the

             a remote host did not work. Fixed.
31.10.2000 - Rereading DIR_CONFIG or HOST_CONFIG is now shown as config
             in the system log.
           - It is now possible to disable retrieving and archiving when
             AFD is up and running.

             AFD_MON_CONFIG file. Fixed.
15.11.2000 - When changing the alias order with edit_hc it sometimes
             happens that FD picks the wrong host entry in the FSA.
             This is hopefully fixed now.
16.11.2000 - Hopefully retrieving of files does now work when we
             already have retrieved part of the file in a previous

             the load on systems that have large archives.
04.12.2000 - Report the exact time when the scanning of directories
             took so long.
           - Calculating the average of scanning directories was done
             wrong. Fixed.
           - Removed Pixmap stuff from afd_info. Caused to much trouble
             when compiling on certain platforms.
05.12.2000 - afd_info will no longer try to get the IP number for
             empty host names or when they are only for the LOC
             group.

           - FD reduces the priority of sf_ftp jobs when they fail for
             certain type of errors (renaming and opening remote file).
             This will give other jobs of the same priority a chance.
16.12.2000 - Some optimization to reduce the number of system calls
             generated by AFD.
18.12.2000 - If sf_xxx failed to archive the file it just send it would
             remain in the internal directory forever, thus filling
             up the files directory until AMG would just stop.
------------------------> Released: 19.12.2000 <---------------------------

             Fixed.
01.03.2001 - Bug in evaluating DIR_CONFIG file. If there are more then
             one recipients in one RECIPIENT group and the first
             recipient is longer then the second one it can happen that
             the second one had garbage in it. Fixed.

             when mapping to a file and the disk is full.
           - Show the hostname and full date where AFD was started or
             stopped in the SYSTEM_LOG.

---------------------------> Version 1.2.5 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
11.04.2001 - show_olog failed to resend files from archive. Fixed.
12.04.2001 - Process dir_check checks the pool directory at start
             for unfinished jobs.
16.04.2001 - Process dir_check scans the files in a job only once.
18.04.2001 - Put a version number into FSA and FRA.
21.04.2001 - New option "pexec" which is the same as the "exec" option
             except that this is executed after a file has been send.
24.04.2001 - Failed to check that MAX_PROCESS_PER_DIR may not be higher
             than MAX_NO_OF_DIR_CHECKS in AFD_CONFIG. Fixed.
           - Process dir_check failed to decrease its own process counter
             for creating children when one of them terminates abnormally.
25.04.2001 - If there is only one job per directory, rename files from
             the pool directory into the files directory.
26.04.2001 - When a sf_xxx process reaches a timeout it will now return
             this status when it exits.
09.05.2001 - When sending files via mail, the message header was not
             separated by a second CRLF from the message body. Fixed.
           - Sending files from the show_olog dialog would always create
             files where the length is always a multiple of the given
             blocksize. Fixed.
12.05.2001 - Option "time no collect" does now see the weekday Sunday.
14.05.2001 - In sf_ftp do the checking for duplicate files only when
             the file size is larger then the transfer block size.
16.05.2001 - During append sf_ftp now puts some of the numbers for the
             file size correctly into the FSA.
17.05.2001 - In function create_fsa() some values where incorrectly
             initialized to zero instead of taking them from the old
             FSA. This effected only detailed selection in afd_ctrl.
           - Replaced gmtime() with localtime() in all log functions.
           - Port to FreeBSD. Thanks to Ying-Chieh Liao!
18.05.2001 - Found another silly bug when evaluating the DIR_CONFIG. It
             didn't like a space in the empty line just before the
             option entry when the last recipient is commented out.
21.05.2001 - Forgot to close socket in ftp_quit() and smtp_quit() under
             error conditions. This is harmless since we always do an exit()
             after the quit, but who knows.
           - The dialog show_log would scroll the SYSTEM_LOG in an endless
             loop when this is larger than 2MB.
23.05.2001 - New option "attach all files" to attach all files to a
             single mail. The option "attach file" will attach each
             file to a separate mail.
26.05.2001 - Put in a counter for the number of jobs queued for each
             host.
27.05.2001 - sf_loc now checks with FD if there is a new job. This should
             reduce the number of forks by FD.
29.05.2001 - When disabling a host and the queue was stopped by hand,
             files in the queue where never deleted. Fixed.
------------------------> Released: 30.05.2001 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.2.6 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
31.05.2001 - For mail attachment, write a Content-Disposition header.
             Some mail readers or MTA's don't like this if it is not there.
01.06.2001 - Fixed nasty bug in dir_check. Process dir_check did always
             wait for all its children to return before scanning the
             directories. This could lead to very long delays, depending
             on the options in DIR_CONFIG.
02.06.2001 - Another bad bug in dir_check. When one directory receives files
             at a very high rate, it can happen that dir_check ends up
             in an endless loop serving only this one directory!
03.06.2001 - In sf_loc removed empty directory to late during a burst. FD
             under rare conditions thought there is a job without a message
             and created one for an empty directory.
------------------------> Released: 06.06.2001 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.2.7 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
14.06.2001 - Failed to initialize file_name_length for output log. This
             caused some entries to be lost by process output_log. Fixed.
15.06.2001 - Process dir_check now receives the correct message when
             HOST_CONFIG is updated with edit_hc.
           - Build in additional checks when evaluating messages.
           - Implemented burst2 for FTP.
17.06.2001 - Process output_log can now handle the situation when the
             fifo overflows.
30.06.2001 - Process afdd is now only started if port number is specified
             in AFD_CONFIG file with the AFD_TCP_PORT identifier.
           - In show_olog mark archive as deleted when its time is up.
01.07.2001 - Info clock of show_xlog dialog now show the directory options.
           - Fixed bug where send dialog of show_olog showed garbage.
03.07.2001 - Forgot to reset connection field in afd_ctrl dialog when
             jobs are being removed.
           - Function copy_file() no longer maps to the whole file but
             does so in chunks.
05.07.2001 - In function get_rename_rules() forgot to terminate buffer
             with a '\0'. Fixed.
07.07.2001 - Function eval_recipient() did not initialize target_dir when
             none was specified in recipient string.
08.07.2001 - Most function in common now use system_log() instead of rec().
           - All sf_xxx process now use function trans_db_log() instead
             of rec().
09.07.2001 - show_olog did not show correct total time when size and
             recipient are specified. Fixed.
10.07.2001 - Reduce priority of a "not working" job by 600 seconds instead
             of 6 seconds.
11.07.2001 - Evaluating the afd.users file could end up in an endless loop
             when there are empty spaces behind the last entry. Fixed.
------------------------> Released: 12.07.2001 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.2.8 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
15.07.2001 - Removed unnecessary fstat() system call in sf_ftp and sf_scp1.
16.07.2001 - Function handle_options() and trans_exec() put the quotes for
             file names with spaces or ";" at the wrong place. Fixed.
           - copy_file() did not copy files of zero length. Fixed.
17.07.2001 - sf_ftp failed to reset the ascii buffer. This could sometimes
             lead to files being send in ASCII mode and not in binary.
18.07.2001 - Implemented "do not remove" option for local directories.
20.07.2001 - The directory option "delete unknown files" WRONGLY deleted
             files in the queue as well. For this reason a new option has
             been added "delete queued files", which will delete old
             queued files. The old option works now as documented.
22.07.2001 - Reduce the timeout to a maximum of 20 second for function
             ftp_get_reply().
25.07.2001 - Did not have enough memory in append functions to store
             the binary zero. Fixed.
           - Under some circumstances function check_burst_2() could
             lead to a SIGSEGV. Hope this has been fixed.
           - Function eval_dir_config() SIGSEGV when identifier groups
             are not separated with an empty line. Thanks to Bellucci
             Massimo for reporting this one.
26.07.2001 - Added function ftp_account() required by some FTP proxies.
29.07.2001 - New dialog show_queue to view and delete files from the
             AFD queue.
30.07.2001 - Function init_sf_burst2() failed to remove empty file
             directories. Fixed.

           - Function check_burst() cooperates better with the new burst2
             code.
07.08.2001 - Fixed some display bugs in job details window of the
             afd_ctrl dialog.
           - Port to AIX.
------------------------> Released: 08.08.2001 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.2.9 <-------------------------------
                            ---------------
14.08.2001 - Fixed a memory leak in afd_ctrl dialog.
           - afdcmd forgot to rewrite the HOST_CONFIG file. Fixed.
20.08.2001 - Forgot to reset no_selected in mon_ctrl dialog.
21.08.2001 - Don't write any debug information during a burst when all
             files have been deleted due to age.
22.08.2001 - Removed some unnecessary locking from all sf_xxx process.
           - sf_wmo took the wrong variable to reduce the number of bytes
             still to be send when the file size was zero. Fixed.
           - sf_ftp will now write the mode type (active/passive) used
             when connecting to the log files.
23.08.2001 - Made appending of files safer by checking the date of file
             as well and not only the file name.
24.08.2001 - Process dir_check splitted extract jobs wrongly. Fixed.
           - The view_dc dialog now shows the directory options.
27.08.2001 - Counted files on input twice when queue was stopped and
             then started again. Fixed.
           - Function remove_files() now removes any files from restart
             option in the message file when a file is deleted due to age.
------------------------> Released: 29.08.2001 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.2.10 <------------------------------
                            ----------------
02.09.2001 - Added function ftp_keepalive(). This is used to keep the
             control connection open on very slow connections that
             transmit large files. Some firewalls close the control
             connection if there is no activity for a longer time.
10.09.2001 - Function get_remote_file_names() sorted the structure
             retrieve_list wrongly. This could cause gf_ftp to crash. Fixed.
11.09.2001 - Hostname was not a compound string in afd_info dialog.
           - Before resending files via the output_log dialog we update
             the date of the files so that when the age-limit option
             is set files will not be deleted by sf_xxx.
17.09.2001 - New parameter (CREATE_SOURCE_DIR_MODE) in AFD_CONFIG file to
             set the mode of the input directories created by AFD.
22.09.2001 - Catch fifo buffer overflows in transfer_log and receive_log.
29.09.2001 - Added one more row to choose from in afd_ctrl and mon_ctrl
             dialog (from Setup menu).
	   - Before resending a file via the show_olog dialog check that
	     we do have the correct permission to update the file. If
	     not copy the file.
           - Fixed long standing bug in show_olog where files renamed
             with the trans_rename option would not be resend. Wonder
             why no one has noticed this!
30.09.2001 - Updated SCP1 functions so renaming works.
01.10.2001 - Dialog view_dc and show_olog did not show the time option
             if specified for that directory. Fixed.
09.10.2001 - Added option to add hostname for rename and trans_rename
             option.
12.10.2001 - Did not reduce priority of a job if the remote directory
             is no longer available. Fixed.
15.10.2001 - Fixed some minor bugs in mon_ctrl dialog.
18.10.2001 - Process FD failed to reset FSA values when a job is removed
             because it is no longer in the DIR_CONFIG.
19.10.2001 - Compiles under HP 10.20 again.
23.10.2001 - Fixed a rename bug in function change_name().
26.10.2001 - Remove rotating dash in job_details dialog, when file has
             been completely transmitted.
28.10.2001 - Compatibility with lesstif has been improved. However there
             are still some issues remaining: drag+drop in edit_hc
             does not work and displaying logs with show_log is still
             problematic.
------------------------> Released: 29.10.2001 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.2.11 <------------------------------
                            ----------------

           - With the help of a \ one can enter directories with spaces.
16.11.2001 - In function init_msg_buffer() when we remove a connection
             queued, check if it is in connection structure and only then
             remove it from the structure.
08.12.2001 - When jobs are removed with the show_queue dialog it did not
             remove the entries in the queue of FD. Fixed.
11.12.2001 - FD initilizes all connection variables every time it starts
             to ensure a sane state when it starts.
------------------------> Released: 12.12.2001 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.2.12 <------------------------------
                            ----------------
15.12.2001 - For scheme mailto the hostname supplied with the server=
             option will be the hostname that is stored in the FSA.
             This will give the administrator the ability to hide all
             mails behind one entry in the afd_ctrl dialog.
16.12.2001 - In show_olog dialog allow users to search full mail addresses.
22.12.2001 - Using variable column length in afd_ctrl dialog to save
             screen space if you do not always set the maximum number
             of jobs per host.
25.12.2001 - The filename used to store configuration of some dialogs
             no longer contains the display and screen number
             (ie. :0.0 part).
26.12.2001 - For afd_ctrl dialog allow for more changes in line style.
29.12.2001 - Due to confusion about Start/Stop queue in the afd_ctrl
             dialog renamed this Start/Stop input queue.
03.01.2002 - Unable to look at logfiles from December in January with
             show_xlog dialogs. Fixed.
10.01.2002 - Set toggle button for input by default in show_queue dialog.
23.01.2002 - Added function eaccess() to test access permission based
             on the effective user ID. This will allow other users to
             resend files or start the AFD.
           - During shutdown AMG could still send jobs to FD while
             this has already terminated. Fixed.
27.01.2002 - Added option reply-to.
30.01.2002 - The number of logfiles that are kept for history can now
             be configured in AFD_CONFIG.

             local directories causing it crash or behave strangly
             when a directory was added or removed and only reread
             HOST_CONFIG was pressed. Reread DIR_CONFIG was fine, but
             another reread HOST_CONFIG could trigger the bug. Fixed.
09.04.2002 - Fixed yet another bug in function change_name().
16.04.2002 - Backward insertion (introduced in 1.2.12) does not work
             correctly, resulting in a completly unsorted queue and
             thus priorities did not work. Using a new algorithm
             which hopefully is faster and does work.
17.04.2002 - Added counter to store maximum FD queue length on a daily
             basis.
19.04.2002 - FD did not remove old jobs from the joblist when it is
             not in the cache. Fixed.

           - Remove any trailing / from the users home path.
20.04.2002 - Use a new sorting algorithm for sorting.
22.04.2002 - FD failed to reset correct jobs_queued element in FSA, when
             retrieving files. Fixed.
25.04.2002 - FD tried to burst retrieve jobs which is not possible.
------------------------> Released: 25.04.2002 <---------------------------


---------------------------> Version 1.2.14 <------------------------------
                            ----------------
03.05.2002 - Added option execd, which works just like exec only
             that it removes the original file after executing the
             command.
05.05.2002 - Dialog dir_ctrl now shows the number of files and bytes
             in the directories and queue that are to be monitored.
           - Automatically convert FRA when the release number (ie.
             the structure) changes.
13.05.2002 - Specifying a group name together with a hostname was not
             handled correctly. Fixed.

22.05.2002 - Separate old file times for unknown and queued files in
             dir_options.
27.05.2002 - Combine FTP rename to one command, not two separate ones.
10.06.2002 - Not specifying a filename for the assemble now gives a
             warning in the receive log.
11.06.2002 - The field dir_alias was not set by FD, after a DIR_CONFIG
             update this could lead to data being written to the end
             of the FRA. Fixed.
14.06.2002 - Assemble MSS did not work. Fixed.
           - Function remove_dir() called closedir() twice in case of
             an error.

             the file name to upper or lower case.
02.07.2002 - Added from option for mail.
03.07.2002 - When reordering the hostnames in afd_ctrl dialog with
             edit_hc it could happen, due to a bug in function
             create_db(), that the files of some directories are just
             deleted. Since there was no reliable way to reproduce this,
             if this fix corrected it. Only time will tell.
           - Added charset option for mail.
04.07.2002 - For mail add To header by default.

---------------------------> Version 1.2.15 <------------------------------
                            ----------------
10.07.2002 - When pexec command creates subdirectories in the files
             directory, FD was unable to delete them and AFD would
             constantly try to generate a new job. Fixed.

12.07.2002 - Files that have no distribution rule and where the option
             "delete old files" is set are now deleted immediatly while
